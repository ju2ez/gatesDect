by bill and melinda gateslink link link link link dear warren your gift a decade ago left us speechless it was the biggest single gift anyone ever gave anybody for anything and we knew we owed you a fantastic return on your investment in this letter we ll share some highlights with you and we ll focus on global health because that was the starting point of our philanthropy and it s the majority of what we do we don t have sales and profits to show you but there are numbers we watch closely to guide our work and measure our progress let s start with the most important one link every september the un announces the number of children under five who died the previous year every year this number breaks my heart and gives me hope it s tragic that so many children are dying but every year more children live link if you add up each year s gains million children under age five have been saved over the past years these are children who would have died if mortality rates had stayed where they were in link saving children s lives is an end in itself but it has other benefits as well if parents believe their children will survive link they have access to contraceptives that let them time and space their pregnancies they re able to choose how many children to have link when a mother can choose how many children to have her children are healthier they re better nourished their mental capacities are higher and parents have more time and money to spend on each child s health and schooling that s how families and countries get out of poverty link coverage for the basic package of childhood vaccines is the highest it s ever been at percent and the coverage gap between rich countries and developing countries is the lowest it s ever been this explains a lot of the gains in childhood survival vaccines are the single biggest reason for the drop in under five deaths link the first day of life is especially dangerous for babies and more than million newborns die in their first month the world hasn t made as much progress in this area as we have in others newborn deaths now represent percent of all childhood deaths up from percent in link but some very poor countries have improved their survival rates by encouraging breastfeeding and increasing the number of trained health workers attending births and health centers we re funding in africa are now doing autopsies so pathologists can learn more about the causes of newborn deaths bill had the opportunity to observe one of these autopsies last year in south africa link malnutrition makes kids more likely to die from childhood diseases it also stunts their growth and hurts their cognitive development link malnutrition destroys the most human potential on the planet we re funding research to identify key nutrients and find ways of getting them into the diets of kids in poor countries when researchers make these discoveries the rise in the number of children who achieve their potential will change the world link in the developing world million women have access to modern contraceptives this number is an all time high but there are still million women in developing countries who want to use modern contraceptives and can t get them that s tragic contraceptives save lives and reduce poverty when women in developing countries space their births by at least three years their children are almost twice as likely to reach their first birthday when women can time and space their pregnancies they are more likely to advance their education earn an income and have healthy children this leads to greater prosperity and it starts with women who have the power to choose how many children to have link poverty is sexist the poorer the society the less power women have men decide if a woman is allowed to go outside talk to other women earn an income the male dominance in poorer societies is mind blowing link fortunately as a society becomes better off a woman s position in that society improves but how do women in poor societies get more power now actually women get more power from other women about million women are involved in self help groups in india alone the groups might form to help women get loans or share health practices but once things get started the women take it in the direction they want to go that is empowerment link in a recent survey just percent knew that the world had cut extreme poverty in half and percent underestimated the progress the survey wasn t just testing knowledge it was testing optimism and the world didn t score so well link optimism isn t just a belief that things will automatically get better it s a belief that we can link things better and in many ways we link making the world better global poverty is going down childhood deaths are dropping literacy is rising the status of women and minorities around the world is improving link warren it won t surprise you to know we re more optimistic than ever link and more impatient too link especially for this link this is the number we re striving toward every day at the foundation zero malaria zero hiv zero tb polio is closest to reaching that magic number in there were new cases of polio worldwide last year there were link those cases were confined to northern nigeria and parts of afghanistan and pakistan immunizing children in conflict areas is hard and dangerous we re in awe of the vaccinators who are taking risks to reach each child link if things stay stable enough in the conflict areas humanity could see its last case of polio sometime this year warren these numbers help capture the successes and struggles in global health the problems are still here because they re so hard to solve but we have confidence in the world s talent energy and empathy and that lets us end our letter with a bright look ahead polio will soon be history in our lifetimes malaria will end no one will die from aids few people will get tb children everywhere will be well nourished and the death of a child in the developing world will be just as rare as the death of a child in the rich world we can t put a date on these events and we don t know the sequence but we re confident of one thing the future will surprise the pessimists thank you for putting your trust in us warren we won t let you down bill and melindalink link link
