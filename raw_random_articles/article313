link wastewater treatment equipment market size industry analysis report regional outlook application development potential price trend competitive market share forecast wastewater treatment equipment market size was worth over usd billion in and is expected to reach more than usd billion by growing at a cagr of more than from to asia pacific was the major contributor and is anticipated to grow at a high rate owing to large population size potable water scarcity and rapid industrialization in countries such as india japan and china u s wastewater treatment equipment market size is likely to witness significant growth due to stringent water regulations and increasing water recycling reusing trend growth in end user industries such as food beverages pharmaceuticals and refineries is likely to fuel europe wastewater treatment equipment market share growth middle east africa mea is anticipated to be an attractive regional segment due to insufficient water management limited supply and outbreak of diseases such as cholera water treatment equipment is required in order to remove unwanted bacteria protozoa virus and suspended solid particles poor water intake directly or indirectly is hazardous to health increasing environmental concern coupled with rising consumer health consciousness is likely to fuel growth request for an in depth table of contents for this report link raw and processed water is used in several applications including cooling washing and processing in various manufacturing industries such as pulp paper pharmaceuticals chemicals power metal mining semiconductors textiles oil gas fast growth in these industries is leading towards more water pollution increasing contamination due to rapid industrialization coupled with scarce resources has led to strict government regulations which is expected to be among the key driving factors for the wastewater treatment equipment market water demand and supply gap accompanied by government regulations towards recycling and reuse projects is likely to fuel growth end use industries growth such as power pharmaceuticals pulp paper refineries dairy food beverages and oil gas are anticipated to drive wastewater treatment equipment market size applications are bifurcated into municipal and industrial segment municipal applications include drinking and individual consumption for various uses such as cleaning bathing and cooking industrial applications consist of food beverages pharmaceuticals electronics power generation mining and oil gas high initial investment cost and lack of awareness among people is likely to restrain growth on the basis of technology equipment can be categorized into disinfection desalination filtration and testing disinfection technology is used for water purification in order to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and limit waterborne diseases and in its distribution increasing popularity of ultraviolet uv disinfection over chlorination owing to its efficiency and cost effective nature is likely to propel demand for uv desalination is a process to remove salt from saline water from sources such as river and sea in order to make it for direct and indirect consumption as of there were over desalination plants globally increasing energy efficient processes trend is likely to create opportunities for hybrid solar desalination filtration equipment used for municipal industrial applications are available in a wide range including table top portable filters to scale up specific systems as per the industry requirements industrial processes that use water always need specific grades which are determined by measuring parameters such as conductivity ph dissolved oxygen content temperature and other dissolved compounds namely microbial count and ammonia regions such as europe and north america are anticipated to witness high demand for this method due to strict norms pertaining to industrial effluent water discharge into water bodies wastewater
