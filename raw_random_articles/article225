link if there is one thing canon knows how to do it is build photographic and printing engines it s high quality line of eos rebel digital slr dslr cameras with its autostabilizing feature and full range of lenses that take advantage of it is a testament to that on the other side of the camera though the printing side one would hope that canon would be up to the design work it has done in the camera world and if it pixma mx wireless all in one printer is any example canon has done it on the printer side too take for example canon s eos s ability to take high definition prints it wouldn t do very well now if the manufacturer of a camera delivered a printer that couldn t deliver the same type of image from one of its hd prints created by either the powershot or eos lineup however canon has not worries there after looking at the inch lcd image of the hd images captured with an eos system canon s printers deliver the same top quality images that its cameras deliver interestingly the pict bridge feature built into the pixma assures that the rd copy of an image or document has the same qualities as the first an enterprise wide printer the pixma isn t as large as some out there but it does need a space of its own and it won t be moving very much as it is nearly pounds and is by by inches these dimensions while not the biggest on the market mean that once you ve placed it you re unlikely to move it that s just as well because there is very little that the pixma can t do including standard printing scanning faxing and copying it is network ready and capable as it understands wifi standard b g n which means that it not only can act as a hotspots for any wireless device but it can is also ethernet capable and if you prefer to use an old fashioned printerserver you can set it up to print through a standard usb cable and a pc the pixma is available with about mb of ram installed and you can up it to by the addition of a standard kingston dimm with all of this going for it you can see that the canon is continuing to be a powerhouse in the office fieldlink not alone in the camera field you can actually create some very nice high definition images up to by borderless with the pixma it is made to compete and it should do so very well article tags link link source link from articlesfactory com
