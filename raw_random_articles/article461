link increasing number of innovative products that are developed by clinical diagnostic manufacturers from the results of clinical and preclinical trials research is boosting the immunofluorescence analyzer market growth immunoassays are biochemical tests that are used to quantify a specific substance or detect an analyte in body fluid sample or in the blood using an antibody or antigen immunoassays are highly specific due to the use of purified antigens and antibodies as reagents and it is sensitive the common uses of immunoassay include hormones measurement of drugs tumor markers markers of cardiac injury and specific proteins immunofluorescence assays are different type of immunoassays the advantages of a fluorescent detection system include higher sensitivity recognition of an analyte simpler assay designs and simplified reagents over the past few decades various advancements such as portability compactness and real time monitoring of analyzer have supported the application of fluorescent based immunoassay system in point of care click to continue reading on link a modern immunofluorescence assay based analyzer uses a florescent compound that absorbs light energy at a specific wavelength and emits energy at a different wavelength the difference between these light energy is called strokes shift immunofluorescence assay analyzers are extensively used in the field of clinical diagnostics research and development and quality control lack of skilled workforce and increasing test volume have led to the growth of immunofluorescence analyzer market size for instance in aesku group received clearance from the food and drug administration fda for its new helios automated immunofluorescence system with aeskuslides ana hep gamma assay helios is based upon automated system for the immunofluorescence processing with image recapturing with an integrated software and fluorescence microscope in a single run helios can process and analyze patient samples over helios systems are used worldwide in clinical research in over countries moreover significance of care is now shifting towards early detection and prevention of diseases therefore private companies are investing huge amount of capital for the development of rapid diagnostic testing solutions and low cost imaging technologies for point of care testing for instance in the food and drug administration provided clearance to quidel s point of care sofia immunoassay analyzer for use with sofia influenza a b assay the next generation version sofia is based on quidel s bestselling sofia instrumented system sofia is integrated with wireless connectivity and uses the florescent chemistry design with optics system to provide automated accurate results in minutes request sample copy of this business report link key vendors abbott laboratories biomerieux emd millipore siemens healthcare thermo fisher scientific and diasorin s p a contact us mr shahlink coherent market insightslink th ave link seattlelink wa link tel link email link visit our news website link source link from articlesfactory com about coherent market insights coherent market insights is a prominent market research and consulting firm offering action ready syndicated research reports custom market analysis consulting services and competitive analysis through various recommendations related to emerging market trends technologies and potential absolute dollar opportunity
