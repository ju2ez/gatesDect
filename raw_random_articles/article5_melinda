on international day of the girl we recognize the unique challenges millions of girls face and we celebrate the ways in which girls change the world when they overcome these challenges i m feeling especially celebratory this year because i believe the future for girls is brighter than ever here are five reasons why women s and girls empowerment is no longer link the global agenda it link the global agenda when world leaders met at the united nations headquarters in new york city last month they advocated for gender equality with an energy i d never seen before and i ve been attending these meetings for about a decade now one highlight was the link by organizations businesses and governments to improve the health and well being of women and girls around the world data is the theme of this year s day of the girl the word data makes some people s eyes glaze over but i proudly describe myself as a data geek i ve seen that what gets measured gets done so to me data isn t numbers on a screen it s progress in people s lives the lack of good data about women and girls makes it impossible to know whether the world is meeting its ambitions on gender equality but that s beginning to change australia and the united states are supporting gender data initiatives and link to improve the way data is collected and used the goal is a full picture of important facets of women s lives such as how they use their time how much unpaid work they do and how they support themselves economically the largest generation of young people in human history is coming of age as a mother of teenagers i know how important this life stage is i also know how difficult it can be new creative programs are empowering young women to find their voice and realize their potential south africa s girls achieve power for example link uses sports to help girls build self esteem and to provide a safe space for discussing pressing issues like hiv teen pregnancy and sexual violence sometimes only adolescents can fully understand the pressures their peers are under and what information and support they really need to tap into these insights our foundation is supporting adolescents an initiative aimed at expanding access to contraceptives for young women and their partners in ethiopia tanzania and nigeria we re funding programs that are designed researched and implemented link young people link young people to respond to their specific needs and combat the stigma and misinformation that can prevent them from accessing contraceptives the courage tenacity and optimism of young leaders like malala yousafzai who risked her life to stand up for a girl s right to education never cease to inspire me i ve been honored to meet amazing emerging leaders like anoyara khatun who was trafficked from her village in west bengal and now campaigns passionately for children s rights and link a young mother who is championing family planning in kenya
