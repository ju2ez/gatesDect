link did you ever read a self help or personal development book you know the type that i mean they re the ones that offer link or link for addressing everything from getting yourself organized to becoming an effective manager or better yet a decisive leader just as an aside have you noticed how being a successful manager doesn t quite cut it anymore have you noticed that being a leader is the hot concept link what s this obsession with leaders anyway and why is it that no one wants managers anymore i mean not everyone can be a leader don t we need at least a horde of followers maybe a flock or two of stragglers an odd dozen wanderers and a few herders who are supposed to try and keep everyone pointed in the same direction but anyway if you have read any of those books tell me honestly can you remember them having an impact a long term impact have you implemented any procedures processes or techniques touted in one of those books that resulted in a significant positive change in your personal or professional life did you stop worrying about who moved the cheese is your life now more purposeful did you sell your ferrari look don t get me wrong i read those books too i find that they re great as a barometer of contemporary thought and they certainly serve a purpose by getting those of us whose noses are too close to the all too familiar grindstone to take a step back and reconsider things at least for short time anyway then as inevitable as our fading new year s resolutions and probably before we even know it there we are with our noses pointed at that grindstone again at least until the next book comes along so for me those books are a diversion an intermission perhaps even a thoughtful academic exodus that gives us pause and then let s us get back to our busy day but has any one of them changed my life well hardly why is that the obvious reason is that the solutions or processes espoused probably came about as a result of at least a little soul searching and most likely a greater degree of experimentation the principle characteristic though and the one that most of us miss is that the practice whatever it may be being touted is generally a behavioral or strategic process that best meshed with that person s beliefs about their choices and about their identity and mission in other words someone had a constraint a problem link to solve or to overcome that someone then came up with a successful process a best practice if you will that was based on personal beliefs on available choices on attitudes and identity and mission and purpose the important thing to note is that the latter criteria beliefs attitudes choice identity and purpose are crucial if not always obvious inputs at arriving at a best practice that is generally behaviour based now what if my beliefs and attitudes my mission and purpose don t mesh with yours will your behaviour based best practice work for me doubtful very doubtful don t believe me that s ok because what i just explained isn t my theory i didn t make it up in fact what i just described to you what i essentially introduced to you was a brief foray an initial scholarly sortie into a framework called link which stems from a body of knowledge called neuro linguistic programming nlp link practitioners of neuro linguistic programming nlp attest that with the logical levels you and i are capable of successfully ordering information and affecting change in our personal social and professional lives interestingly just as einstein opined that a solution to a problem cannot be found with the same thinking that created the problem in the first place the logical levels maintain that no effective long lasting change at any given level of thinking can be accomplished without an elevation in thinking to at least the next logical level for instance a desire for change at the link level the level at which we ask questions that start with the word link cannot be accomplished if the thinking remains at the link level to undergo a behavioral change requires a shift an elevation in thinking to at least the next level which is the link or link level therefore to embark on a change in link we re doinglink requires an examination of link we re doing it and to affect a change in link we re doing something requires consideration of link we re doing it the hierarchy below illustrates starting at the top each element of the logical levels link link link link link link link link link link link link link link link link link best practices by definition chiefly address from a logical level perspective thinking at the link and link levels my suspicion is that best practices only work for the persons or organizations that created them and the reason they work for those organizations is not because of the behaviour or strategy inherent in the best practices but rather because of the beliefs the values the attitudes and identity embedded in the practices don t believe me consider this in the late s a famous guitarist by the name of django reinhardt narrowly escaped with his life from a fire that engulfed his caravan although he fortunately survived the ordeal he suffered terrible debilitating burns to his left hand the burns were severe enough to render useless his baby and ring finger undeterred reinhardt developed a guitar technique that incorporated the use of his two able fingers he subsequently went on to great fame and attracted a rabid fan base whether those fans were enraptured by his melodic improvisations or by his dogged victory over his obvious handicap i m not sure but the fact is that reinhardt to this day is in jazz circles considered a guitar god would you then conclude that for students of reinhardt s music his unique technique based on his inability to make use of two fingers be considered a best practice absurd preposterous and yet be aware that there indeed are musicians reinhardt wannabes the world over who readily wrap tape around and therefore disable two fingers of their left hand whether they do this in the hopes of emulating the reinhardt sound or whether they feel somehow inspired by mimicking the great guitarist s liability is a moot point the fact is that they ignore the beliefs the identity and the purpose that led reinhardt to develop his technique and that effectively is my complete point the blind adoption of someone else s best practices also ignores the circumstances that caused that certain someone to develop the best practices in the first place and this ignorance in my view is what renders so many best practices useless link there once was an aboriginal tribe of rain dancers that was renowned for its unique and unfailingly successful ability to manifest rain other tribes traveled for days and days to observe this successful band of rain dancers these other tribes noted whether the dancers circled clockwise or counter clockwise they studied their dance steps they committed to memory the dancers chants their eye movements and their manner of dress yet not one not one could duplicate this band s success for as much as everyone observed and mimicked the rain dancers technique there was one thing that no one noticed and it was simply this because of the tribe s beliefs mission and purpose when they started dancinglink they continued dancing and didn t stop until it rained source link from articlesfactory com
