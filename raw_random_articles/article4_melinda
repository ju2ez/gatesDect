the holidays are the season for giving and one of the things i ve loved giving my own children over the years is a passion for learning and as a computer science nerd with two daughters i m particularly interested in helping give girls the confidence to pursue their interest in math and science that s why i ve put together a stem gift guide with ideas for toys games and books that i hope will delight kids while encouraging them to find creative answers to challenging puzzles it s important for them to know that following their curiosity is one of the best ways to have fun and that it s a key ingredient to leading a fulfilling life these gifts are a good start learn geometry with these fun and link and they re less painful for parents to step on than other blocks great stocking stuffers try link by randi zuckerberg link by ben hatke and link by andrea beaty build link with working elevators and a ferris wheel bonus roominate was founded by two women engineers
