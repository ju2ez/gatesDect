this week i m in london to mark an important milestone five years ago leaders from all over the world came together to insist on making family planning a global priority together we made a promise to enable million more women and girls to use modern contraceptives by with the goal of achieving universal access to contraceptives for everyone everywhere now we re back in the u k to celebrate our progress and prepare to meet the challenges ahead i truly believe the conversation around contraceptives is one of the most important conversations the world will have this year i ve link but like a lot of people i thought of family planning as a personal issue not a global one i couldn t imagine speaking about it publicly everything changed when bill and i launched our foundation and i started spending time with women in the world s poorest places everywhere i went the conversation turned to contraceptives i met women who were getting pregnant too young too old and too often for their bodies to handle i met women who were desperate not to get pregnant again because they couldn t afford to feed or care for the children they already had in malawi everyone i met knew someone who had died in pregnancy in india i asked a group of women if anyone had lost a child and every single woman raised her hand when i started studying the data i learned that contraceptives are an essential part of the healthier more prosperous world we re all working toward when a woman has access to contraceptives she tends to have fewer children families can devote more resources to each child s nutrition health and education setting them up for a better future women are freer to work outside the home earn an income and contribute to the economy multiply that by millions of families and it becomes clear why contraceptives are one of the greatest antipoverty innovations the world has ever known and one of the smartest investments countries can make for all of these reasons i can t turn my back on the women i meet they bring up contraceptives because their lives depend on it and i am committed to making sure their voices are heard expanding access to contraceptives is a priority for our foundation we partner with an incredible link many of which are already decades into this work over the past five years the family planning partnership has made significant gains we ve reached tens of millions more women in developing countries with access to contraceptives and looking ahead we know the data we ve collected and the lessons we ve learned will help us ensure that progress reaches more women in more places we also know that our advocacy is needed now more than ever this is a difficult political climate for family planning i m deeply concerned about the white house s proposed budget cuts to global family planning efforts if empowering women is more than just rhetoric for the president he will prove it by protecting this funding and the stakes will only get higher the politics of the moment don t change the fact that the world is at the cusp of a demographic tipping point there are billion adolescents in the world today the largest generation in human history if we link including the tools to prevent teenage pregnancy these young men and women will unlock unprecedented growth in the world s poorest countries but for this generation to achieve their promise the family planning community must first keep ours that s why i just announced that our foundation is committing an additional million to this work to be used over the next three years this additional funding won t begin to fill the gap that proposed u s budget cuts could create but it will help build a bridge to the women and girls we have yet to reach alongside our partners we will prioritize the needs of adolescents and youth we will work to ensure that women and girls have reliable access to a range of contraceptive options so that they can find one that fits their needs we will also keep investing in the data to make these programs more effective especially data on adolescents link link
