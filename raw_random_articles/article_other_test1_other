applications of neural networks have expanded significantly in recent years from image segmentation to natural language processing to time series forecasting one notably successful use of deep learning is embedding a method used to represent discrete variables as continuous vectors this technique has found practical applications with word embeddings for link and link in this article i ll explain what neural network embeddings are why we want to use them and how they are learned we ll go through these concepts in the context of alink representing all the books on wikipedia as vectors to create a book recommendation system
