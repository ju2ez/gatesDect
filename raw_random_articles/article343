link offers the proper records on public records through an on the web database offers how the files are acquired in the net the best way to prove the happening of something would always be through the use of evidence and when one talks about evidence perhaps the best evidence that one could present would be the official records of the government these official records like link are the best evidence because of some inherent characteristics that public records have but at the same time one must note that these records are actually rather limited in the sense that they could only prove that which is written upon their face thus a death certificate could not prove the fact of the birth of the person named in the death certificate even if it be necessary that a person be born first before he or she could die link link the government makes and keep records not only because they are mandated by the law to do so but also because it is the best way that they could fulfill their mandate of bringing information to the public when the public so requires the same these records also serve as a means for those who have oversight over these offices to check on the work of these offices in accordance with the checks and balance a well as their oversight functions link link public records are the best evidence because they enjoy two characteristics that are not usually afforded to regular records the first of these would be the fact that these records are supposed to be available to the public at all times thus anyone may make a request for the records though mostly it is only those who have a legitimate interest in the records who do so the second is that these records enjoy the presumption of regularity which means that they would always be presumed to be correct as long as they are issued by the proper office of course this presumption is not conclusive and may be overturned by competent evidence link link copies of public records are available at both the local or county level and the state or national level though where exactly the best place to make a search would be would depend on a number of factors including the knowledge of the person making the search as to where the event in question had happened if the searcher is aware then the best place to make the search would be at the local level as there would be fewer records here and they would only keep records of events that had happened within their county lines of course if he is not aware then it would be best to take the search at the state level for there would be records from all counties at that level despite a search here being slower than the one that could be done at the local level link link another place to search for copies of mendocino county court records would be online through the use of online databases faster more efficient and cheaper to use these are mostly privately owned but despite thislink the information that they provide is substantially similar to that which are provided by the official archives source link from articlesfactory com produces essential data on birth records it provides information in just a few minutes through an internet records provider
