link describes the reliable program to obtain the public records via the internet showcases how you can do the lookup while using the internet governments are supposed to be able to provide to the public information that the law regards as important to the welfare of the public and there are various information that would fall under that category of course it is physically impossible for the governments to be able to tell everything to their constituents and there is also the fact that not all of the people are actually interested in what the government is doing in order to provide the information to the public yet be able to limit the information that is actually being presented the government makes available to the public records known as public records and an example of such records would be link the contents of these records are the official records of the government in regards to the information that is written on the records and because of this they are presumed to be true and accurate at all times but one must note that the presumption would only be as to the actual contents of the records and nothing else thus if the information could be inferred from what is written on the records but is not written on the records itself then these records could not prove the same no matter how obvious that information inferred would be this is a limitation that all public records share as the name implies these records are supposed to be available to the public at all times a person may make the request for copies of the records no matter what reason such person may or even may not have in theory any person could make the request for the records so long as that person could identify the record or records that he or she is interested in though in practice only those who do have a legitimate interest in the records in question would make the request given that these records do not actually come for free though the required fee is usually very minimal a request for copies of the records would usually be done at the place where the records were first made though in the case of some records the law would identify an official custodian for the same and it is only at the office of the official custodian that a person could make the request for copies of the records in question the method for making the request would depend on the office where the records would be made but in general the methods that could be used to make the request would either be to make the request in person or to make the request through the mail with both methods having their own set of advantages and disadvantages that would have to be taken into consideration when making the decision as to which method to use lubbock county court records public access could also be done online through the use of online databases which are mostly privately owned databases even if they could present records that would be substantially the same as those which could be obtained from the official databases these databases could provide the information faster more efficiently and cheaper though note that because they are not official sourceslink they could not enjoy the presumption of regularity article tags link link link link link link link link source link from articlesfactory com incorporates the huge volume of information about the general public records features the way they are requested for and purchased through the web
