as my family and i get ready for the beginning of the new school year i find myself thinking a lot about my own days in school over and over again through my work with the foundation i ve seen that school today is much more creative and supportive than it was when i was a kid here are some of the eye opening lessons i ve learned from students and teachers at some of the schools i ve visited over the last few years when i talked to sumi and zanaasha at link i was impressed by how much they said they had learned from their teachers not just academically but also personally here and in many other schools i visit i see teachers helping kids learn how to set priorities advocate for themselves and figure out what their values are if we encourage our kids to see teachers as sources of knowledge link as role models they ll have even more positive influences in their lives students are a lot more in tune with their feelings than i remember being the link link a housing and scholarship program for women pursuing computer science engineering and information technology degrees told me that they gather weekly to write their highs and lows on post its whether they re significant or silly and stick them on the wall in their living room i make a habit of sharing roses and thorns with my kids but whatever we call them it s important for our kids to know that it s okay to have both ups and downs fear of failure is so common and so destructive that s why i was blown away at link to see student after student talking about not just what they were good at but also what they were having trouble with and what they were doing to get better if an adult had visited my school i would have found all the tests i got an a on and put them right on top but if we let our kids risk imperfection they ll be a lot more resilient when they head into the world ricky thacker who teaches algebra at link in kentucky noticed that his classroom looked a lot like classrooms from a hundred years ago so he got rid of all his desks taped x and y axes to the floor of his classroom and with his wife s help repainted the room they chose orange and yellow if we support innovative fresh approaches even ones that scare us a little bit our kids will benefit one thing that s stayed the same since i was young is that kids have big dreams about the world and their place in it take briana palacios a recent graduate of the link in texas she was studying ap computer science ap calculus and ap digital electronics and as you can see in the video below she like so many of the kids i ve met over the last few years was thinking a lot further ahead than her exams when she starts college this month the first in her family to do so she ll be studying mechanical engineering i get more inspired every time i visit a school and meet the young people who will shape our world and build a better future
