last week i mentioned i d be reviewing jared diamond s latest book and invited you to share your thoughts on the book i wasn t sure what the response would be it wasn t exactly light beach reading and ten days isn t much time to find and finish a page book but i was pleased by how many people responded thanks to everyone who weighed in a number of commenters hadn t heard of diamond before but i was encouraged by link from addison staples i was actually lucky enough as a teenager to be required to read link as preparatory reading for ap world history i was blown away probably the only book i was ever forced to read in school that absolutely engaged and enlightened me that s great every student deserves to be inspired like that as for the new book link wrote that it is a very good read in my opinion but nothing more it lacks the great enlightenment of the other books that diamond has written i had a similar reaction diamond starts with the premise that human beings were hunter gatherers for millions of years and only settled down when we began farming about years ago so most of our genetic selection has been done in a hunter gatherer environment he argues that we can learn a lot by studying hunter gatherer societies in places like new guinea where he has spent much of his career he uses the term new guinea to refer to the island that is divided between indonesia and papua new guinea he describes several areas in particular like raising children dealing with the elderly and eating well he doesn t romanticize these societies as i thought he might or make some grand pronouncement that they all do these things better than we do he just wants to find the best practices and share them unfortunately i didn t find much deep wisdom in the lessons that diamond documentslink but i found the book fascinating anyway in part that s because diamond has such good anecdotes there s one involving a new guinean nomad who finds a small tree coming out of the ground and becomes convinced it s a sign of danger as i read the story i was sure something bad was about to happen diamond eventually concludes that the man was right but not for the reasons i expected at a broader level link made me think about how we have had to overcome some deeply ingrained behaviors in order to develop a modern interconnected society as diamond explains in a hunter gatherer society you trust people in your own group because you know for the most part they share your interests but when you encounter strangers you have to assume they re dangerous you have a strong incentive to do this if you don t and you turn out to be wrong they could end up killing you or stealing your food things are different in a modern society you probably passed by a lot of strangers today without having to figure out whether they might try to kill you or take your lunch that is a very primal fear we have overcome in order to live in large cities consider how important this has been for global trade and international travel how many strangers have to do business with each other every day to make the global economy work although globalization has been driven by inventions like the jet engine and the standardized shipping container it wouldn t be happening unless we were also able to overcome a natural suspicion of strangers it is another reminder of humans amazing ability to adapt how did this shift happen diamond writes a bit about how on a local level like for tribes in new guinea it s driven by the need to share scarce resources such as food but it s not really his main point one book that gets deeper into these questions is link by matt ridley ridley focuses on trade more broadly and what it took to overcome these very basic barriers to working with strangers i d recommend it to anyone who is interested in this area i did appreciate a few of the other observations in diamond s book he is convincing in suggesting that we reconsider how much we isolate the elderly it is a waste to have people with experience and the free time to share it and lots of young people who would benefit from it but no way to connect them this is an area where i think communications technology could still make a big difference in short if you re only going to read one jared diamond book make it link but if you have a particular interest in what life is like for hunter gatherers link is a good choice finally a number of commenters suggested similar books to diamond s link mentioned link which is one of my favorite books ever and one i think everyone should read you can find my review link link and others recommended link which i disagreed with pretty strongly and reviewed link thanks again to everyone who participated in this experiment i ll be moving on to some of the other titles on link and will post more reviews when i can
