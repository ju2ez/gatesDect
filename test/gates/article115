by this i don t just mean the rainforest you see in this photo i mean everything that can be consumed on earth plants animals all of it and by we of course i mean people it s such a big question that many people wouldn t even know where to start but if you care about understanding the impact that humans are having on the earth and what that means for our future it s a crucial question vaclav smil sets out to answer it in his book link there is no author whose books i look forward to more than vaclav smil he jokes that no one reads his books he s written more than of them it s true that each book only sells a few thousand copies but i m trying to read everything he writes why he understands a phenomenal range of subjects from energy to agriculture on any page he might talk about meat eating among bonobos or the average human life span during the roman empire plus he is rigorously numeric using data to illuminate every topic he writes about the word polymath was invented to describe people like him in link smil gives as clear and as numeric a picture as is possible of how humans have altered the biosphere the book is a bit dry and i had to look up a number of terms that were unfamiliar to me but it tells a critical story smil starts with a big question how much life is there in the biosphere by biosphere he means everywhere on earth where there are living things in the air on the ground and in the oceans i ve been thinking and link about measurement this year and i was very impressed with how rigorously he thinks about this problem ultimately he concludes that the dry mass of all living things on earth is about trillion metric tons because living things contain different amounts of water smil makes these calculations using dry mass which leaves out the water smil tries to figure out what portion of the biosphere s primary productivity the amount of plant life generated each year by photosynthesis is consumed by humans he estimates that we will harvest roughly percent of what the biosphere grows this year mostly plants he admits it could be as little as percent or as much as percent link he describes vividly how humans impact on the earth has changed over time we first had a big impact roughly years ago when we figured out how to burn down forests to clear land for crops today we harvest crops for four main purposes to feed animals feed humans generate fuel and make paper and construction materials smil shows how out of all these the first two are responsible for the biggest impact on the biosphere about percent of the earth s land mass is now devoted to farmland twelve percent is a big number but it would be even bigger if it weren t for innovations in crop breeding field machinery and other areas that made farming much more efficient if crop yields had remained stagnant since in the year we would have needed nearly four times more crop land to feed everyone that s practically half of all the ice free land in the world we ve also had a huge impact on the biosphere by building major cities which essentially eliminate or drastically reduce any natural productivity from those areas smil notes that major cities now cover nearly five million square kilometers if you clustered them all together they would cover an area percent larger than india here s another way to see our impact on the biosphere which do you think weighs more human beings and domesticated animals or all the wild vertebrates in the world i would have guessed all the vertebrates here are the facts in the dry mass of humans was about million metric tons for all domesticated animals it was million tons that s a total of million tons compared to just million tons for all wild vertebrates it s pretty mind blowing click on the plus sign below to explore more in the course of reading the book you learn a great deal about how population and consumption have changed over time it is amazing how little meat was available in most diets as recently as just a few kilograms per year versus about kg of meat per year in an average american diet today the average indian by contrast eats about kg of meat each year the world now harvests far more crops to feed animals that produce meat dairy and eggs than to feed humans but in some ways we ve been less responsible in the sea than on land we don t harvest a high percentage of all the life in the sea but we concentrate on a very few species especially carnivorous fish like cod and tuna smil writes that most of the traditionally targeted species and major fishing areas are now being fished to capacity if they re not already overfished near collapse or collapsing it s a sobering picture link what does all this mean for the decades ahead smil looks at the future with some concern as more people join the middle class they will demand more to eat and more meat in particular which will put an even bigger strain on the biosphere he lists a number of steps we could take which boil down to various ways to manage resources more carefully stabilize the global population and pursue research that will raise crop yields i was a bit surprised that he didn t talk more about innovations that will help avoid some of the problems he s concerned about for example he writes a lot about the impact of meat eating on the biosphere producing meat is very inefficient to get kg of edible meat from a cow you have to feed it about kg of grain but he doesn t mention the possibility of making alternatives to meat which could reduce the inefficiency and the need for additional crops a few months ago i posted a neat feature about research on alternatives to meat i ve tasted a few and they re very convincing i had a chance to ask smil about this when we met this year he pointed out that humans eat about million tons of meat a year and producing even a small percentage of that amount in meat alternatives would be a real challenge i agree that it ll take more research but i remain optimistic that it could help reduce the impact of meat eating on the earth anyway these criticisms are relatively minor if you want to learn about agriculture or the environment and you have the patience to stick with it this is a great text in link vaclav smil carefully adds up how much life exists on earth without moralizing he makes a convincing case that humans could soon consume an unsustainable share of life on earth
