i m in paris for the big meeting on climate change hosted by president macron leaders from around the world are here to take stock of the progress the world is making on this urgent challenge this is a pivotal moment we need to adapt to the climate change that is already affecting the planet and develop new tools that will keep the problem from getting worse innovation is key to doing both scientific advances in crop science for example will help farmers deal with changing weather patterns and energy research will make it possible to power modern life the way we live work travel and make things without adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere the good news is that there s a lot of progress to report on both fronts here s an overview of the developments i ll be highlighting in paris link the world needs to invest much more in energy research than it has been two years ago countries launched an effort called link in which they committed to doubling their spending on energy r d by today mission innovation has grown to members raising the group s total commitment to more than billion the growing list of partners also includes the private sector in we started the link a group of investors who are supporting entrepreneurs working on new sources of clean energy today the bec is adding companies banks funds and institutional investors the members of the bec have committed billions of dollars to creating new energy companies and commercializing new energy products just as important we ll also be working to speed up the pace of progress the world can t afford to wait the decades that it usually takes to develop promising technology find investors connect with governments willing to roll it out and reach customers our goal is to bring ideas out of the lab and into the market much faster that s why i m excited that link public and private funding for energy research often isn t coordinated which is one reason some promising technologies never make it to market the members of mission innovation and the bec will bridge that gap they ll work together to match cutting edge scientists in government labs with investors who can help turn their ideas into products they ll also partner with governments to make it easier to create and deploy new tools as a first step the bec will work with four countries canada mexico france and the united kingdom as well as the european commission on ways to coordinate public and private efforts link link has hired a staff of accomplished investors company builders scientists and technologists they have identified five areas that are especially promising but also underfunded this is where we will focus our investments link roughly million poor people in sub saharan africa and south asia rely on agriculture for their food and income as the climate warms and the weather becomes more unpredictable their crops will become dramatically less productive and could be wiped out altogether as many as million people may be forced to migrate to regions where they can grow enough to survive innovation can help prevent that kind of catastrophe for our part the gates foundation is investing in three areas that developing countries have said are especially crucial one is improving crops for example developing varieties that yield more food so farmers can get more for the work they put in the second is protecting crops by making them able to resist diseases and tolerate the droughts and floods that will become more frequent the third area is giving farmers more advanced ways to manage crops in a changing climate helping them analyze their soil for example or use water more efficiently and because progress depends on brilliant researchers contributing their talents we re also co funding a fellowship program that will train african and european scientists all told we will spend more than million in these areas over the next three years of course our work is only part of the effort to spark innovation that helps farmers adapt to a changing climate the european commission is also committing more than million over the next three years bringing the total to over million in new money through as you can see there s a lot going on i m optimistic that if we keep up this momentum we can stop climate change and help those who are being hurt the most by it all while meeting the world s growing energy needs
