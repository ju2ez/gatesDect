here in seattle summer is a gift you earn by gutting out nine months of rain and gloom the skies are clear there s hardly any humidity and the nights are cool best of all you sometimes get the chance to sit outside reading a great book this summer my recommended reading list has a good dose of books with science and math at their core but there s no science or math to my selection process the following five books are simply ones that i loved made me think in new ways and kept me up reading long past when i should have gone to sleep as a result this is an eclectic list from an page science fiction novel by a local legend to a page nonfiction book on how japan can get its economic mojo back i hope you find at least one book here that inspires you to go off the beaten path when you get some time to yourself this summer link link link i hadn t read any science fiction for a decade when a friend recommended this novel i m glad she did the plot gets going in the first sentence when the moon blows up people figure out that in two years a cataclysmic meteor shower will wipe out all life on earth so the world unites on a plan to keep humanity going by launching as many spacecraft as possible into orbit you might lose patience with all the information you ll get about space flight stephenson who lives in seattle has clearly done his research but i loved the technical details link inspired me to rekindle my sci fi habit link link link ellenberg a mathematician and writer explains how math plays into our daily lives without our even knowing it each chapter starts with a subject that seems fairly straightforward electoral politics say or the massachusetts lottery and then uses it as a jumping off point to talk about the math involved in some places the math gets quitelink complicated but he always wraps things up by making sure you re still with him the book s larger point is that as ellenberg writes to do mathematics is to be at once touched by fire and bound by reason and that there are ways in which we re link doing math all the time link link link link link nick is one of those original thinkers who makes you say link he is trying to right a scientific wrong by getting people to fully appreciate the role that energy plays in all living things he argues that we can only understand how life began and how living things got so complex by understanding how energy works it s not just theoretical mitochondria the power plants in our cells could play a role in fighting cancer and malnutrition even if the details of nick s work turn out to be wrong i suspect his focus on energy will be seen as an important contribution to our understanding of where we come from link link link i have a soft spot for japan that dates back three decades or so when i first traveled there for microsoft today of course japan is intensely interesting to anyone who follows global economics why were its companies the juggernauts of the s eclipsed by competitors in south korea and china and can they come back those questions are at the heart of this series of dialogues between ryoichi an economist who died in and his son hiroshi founder of the internet company rakuten although i don t agree with everything in hiroshi s program i think he has a number of good ideas link is a smart look at the future of a fascinating country link link link both melinda and i read this one and it has sparked lots of great conversations at our dinner table harari takes on a daunting challenge to tell the entire history of the human race in just pages he also writes about our species today and how artificial intelligence genetic engineering and other technologies will change us in the future although i found things to disagree with especially harari s claim that humans were better off before we started farming i would recommend link to anyone who s interested in the history and future of our species
