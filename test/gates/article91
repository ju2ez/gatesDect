terminology is an occupational hazard of philanthropy i ve found this is especially true if you work in an area like health it is not unusual to be discussing the latest disease research and hear someone throw around words like link and link and more complicated ones over the years i ve gotten comfortable with all the terms but at first i had to keep reminding myself link link i still go through that process today with different subjects so it was fun to read randall munroe s new book link which will come out on november munroe sets out to explain various subjects from how smartphones work to what the u s constitution says without any complicated terms instead he draws blueprint style diagrams and annotates them using only the most common words in the english language a nuclear reactor is a heavy metal power building a dishwasher is a box that cleans food holders the periodic table is the pieces everything is made of it is a brilliant concept if you can t explain something simply you don t really understand it and randall munroe is the perfect guy to take on a project like this he s a former nasa robotics expert who now makes a living drawing the geeky comic strip link and writing books i reviewed his link earlier this year munroe reminds me of sal khan of link or the novelist and link host john green all three are polymaths who not only know a lot but are also good at breaking things down for other people link may use a limited vocabulary but it is filled with helpful explanations and drawings have you ever wondered why frozen food defrosts unevenly in a microwave oven or as munroe calls it a food heating radio box munroe writes when you put iced food in a radio box after a while parts of it start to turn to water but since radio boxes are really good at heating water those parts start to get hot really fast they can even get so hot they start turning to air before all the ice is even gone if you know munroe s previous work it will come as no surprise that parts of link are laugh out loud funny here for example is what he says about the business end of a saturn v rocket u s space team s up goer five lots of fire comes out here this end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space if it starts pointing toward space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today or his take on the link amendment to the u s constitution let s get rid of beer and wine and then the link never mind about getting rid of beer and wine if i have a criticism of link it s that the clever concept sometimes gets in the way of clarity occasionally i found myself wishing that munroe had allowed himself a few more terms mars instead of red world or helium instead of funny voice air of course that would defeat the purpose of the book and munroe himself is aware of the tension in page before the book starts a k a the introduction he acknowledges that some terminology is inescapable to really learn about things you need help from other people and if you want to understand those people you need to know what they mean by the words they use you also need to know what things are called so you can ask questions about them but there are lots of other books that explain what things are called this book explains what they do and it does that beautifully link is filled with cool basic knowledge about how the world works if one of munroe s drawings inspires you to go learn more about a subject including a few extra terms then he will have done his job he has written a wonderful guide for curious minds
