if you were living on a day what would you do to improve your life that s a real question for the nearly billion people living in extreme poverty today there s no single right answer of course and poverty looks different in different places but through my work with the foundation i ve met many people in poor countries who raise chickens and i have learned a lot about the ins and outs of owning these birds as a city boy from seattle i had a lot to learn it s pretty clear to me that just about anyone who s living in extreme poverty is better off if they have chickens in fact if i were in their shoes that s what i would do i would raise chickens here s why dr batamaka som an anthropologist from burkina faso who has worked with our foundation has spent much of his career studying the economic impact of raising chickens in his home country in this video he explains why he is so passionate about poultry link our foundation is betting on chickens alongside partners throughout sub saharan africa we are working to create sustainable market systems for poultry it s especially important for these systems to make sure farmers can buy birds that have been properly vaccinated and are well suited to the local growing conditions our goal to eventually help percent of the rural families in sub saharan africa raise improved breeds of vaccinated chickens up from just percent now when i was growing up chickens weren t something you studied they were something you made silly jokes about it has been eye opening for me to learn what a difference they can make in the fight against poverty it sounds funny but i mean it when i say that i am excited about chickens
