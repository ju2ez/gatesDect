i ve read some terrific books lately when i pulled together this list of five that you might enjoy this summer i realized that several of my choices wrestle with big questions what makes a genius tick why do bad things happen to good people where does humanity come from and where are we headed despite the heavy subject matter all these books were fun to read and most of them are pretty short even the longest link goes quickly if you re looking for something to read over the next few months you can t go wrong with link i think leonardo was one of the most fascinating people ever although today he s best known as a painter leonardo had an absurdly wide range of interests from human anatomy to the theater isaacson does the best job i ve seen of pulling together the different strands of leonardo s life and explaining what made him so exceptional a worthy follow up to isaacson s great biographies of albert einstein and steve jobs link when bowler a professor at duke divinity school is diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer she sets out to understand why it happened is it a test of her character the result is a heartbreaking surprisingly funny memoir about faith and coming to grips with your own mortality link i thought i knew everything i needed to know about abraham lincoln but this novel made me rethink parts of his life it blends historical facts from the civil war with fantastical elements it s basically a long conversation among ghosts including lincoln s deceased son i got new insight into the way lincoln must have been crushed by the weight of both grief and responsibility this is one of those fascinating ambiguous books you ll want to discuss with a friend when you re done link david created my favorite course of all time link it tells the story of the universe from the big bang to today s complex societies weaving together insights and evidence from various disciplines into a single narrative if you haven t taken big history yet link is a great introduction if you have it s a great refresher either way the book will leave you with a greater appreciation of humanity s place in the universe link i ve been recommending this book since the day it came out hans the brilliant global health lecturer who died last year gives you a breakthrough way of understanding basic truths about the world how life is getting better and where the world still needs to improve and he weaves in unforgettable anecdotes from his life it s a fitting final word from a brilliant man and one of the best books i ve ever read
