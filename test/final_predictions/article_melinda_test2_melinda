my eldest daughter is years old i was horrified to learn last week that globally suicide is the link among girls her age the crisis of suicide among adolescent girls ages has been hiding in plain sight for years it was second on the list of causes of death for that particular demographic group right below maternal mortality i ve talked a lot about the fact that complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for adolescent girls that s one of the reasons i care so much about family planning which helps women time their births so they and their babies are healthy and that s why i ve recently been speaking out against child marriage which often means that girls become pregnant before their bodies are ready for it i ve been very glad to see maternal mortality go down a little more slowly among girls than among older women but down nonetheless now it s gone down far enough for suicide to take its place on top of the list link in global health we tend to focus on protecting people from link invaders bacteria parasites and viruses and that s saving lives every day meanwhile though girls have been suffering on the link and harming themselves without the global health community really taking note we don t have a perfect handle on precisely why rates of suicide are so high among adolescent girls but all the clues point in one direction societies that hold girls to rigid expectations about who they should be and what they can accomplish which is every society in the world to one extent or another can make girls feel lost ashamed and hopeless one study of suicide in nepal where suicide rates are going up says that girls who harm themselves are reacting to being trapped in a perennial cycle of dependence roughly one in three girls aged suffer violence at the hands of their intimate partners no surprise violence is correlated to anxiety and depression and those mental illnesses are correlated to suicide link the very hard truth is that the world we made is leading girls to consider suicide as their best option there are suicide prevention policies and programs that can chip away at the problem but if we want to get at its root we need to make a new world in which girls and women are treated equally and know their infinite worth
