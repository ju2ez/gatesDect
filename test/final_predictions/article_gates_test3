quick think of some inventions that help fight climate change what came to mind first i bet you thought of solar panels and wind turbines in my experience that s what people point to when they think about reducing greenhouse gas emissions they re not wrong renewables are getting cheaper and many countries are committing to rely more on them and less on fossil fuels for their electricity needs that s good news at least in places that get a lot of sunlight or wind everyone who cares about climate change should hope we continue to de carbonize the way we generate electricity i wish that were enough to solve the problem unfortunately it isn t making electricity is responsible for only of all greenhouse gas emissions each year so even if we could generate all the electricity we need without emitting a single molecule of greenhouse gases which we re a long way from doing we would cut total emissions by just a quarter to prevent the worst effects of climate change we need to get to zero net greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy within years and as link we need to be on a path to doing it in the next years that means dealing with electricity and the other too where do greenhouse gas emissions come from i like to break it down into five main categories what i call the link the final is a sixth miscellaneous category that includes things like the energy it takes to extract oil and gas i think these grand challenges are a helpful way to think about climate change they show how energy isn t just what runs your house and your car it s core to nearly every part of your life the food you eat the clothes you wear the home you live in the products you use to stop the planet from getting substantially warmer link not just how we power our homes and cars link these challenges are only getting more urgent the world s middle class has been growing at an unprecedented rate and as you move up the income ladder your carbon footprint expands instead of walking everywhere you can afford a bicycle which doesn t use gas but is likely made with energy intensive metal and gets to you via cargo ships and trucks that run on fossil fuels eventually you get a motorbike so you can travel farther from home to work a better job and afford to send your kids to school your family eats more eggs meat and dairy so they get better nutrition you re in the market for a refrigerator electric lights so your kids can study at night and a sturdy home built with metal and concrete all of that new consumption translates into tangible improvements in people s lives it is good for the world overall but it will be very bad for the climate unless we find ways to do it without adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere this is undoubtedly a tough problem it is not obvious what the big breakthroughs will look like most likely we will need several solutions to each challenge that is whylink fortunately governments and the private sector are stepping up since the launch of link two dozen governments that committed to doubling their spending on clean energy r d the amount of funding available has gone up by more than billion a year personally i m part of a group of investors in a private fund called link bev which is putting more than billion into helping promising companies take great ideas from the lab to market at scale we re using the five grand challenges i mentioned above as the framework for our investments every idea we re supporting is designed to solve one of them and link from a new partnership in europe we re still working out the details but here s what i can tell you today i ll be in brussels this week to sign an agreement between breakthrough energy and the european commission our goal is to create a joint investment vehicle called breakthrough energy europe which will serve as a pilot fund investing in european companies working on the grand challenges the partners will commit million half from the european commission and half from bev but this isn t only about funding link because energy research can take years even decades to come to fruition companies need patient investors who are willing to work with them over the long term governments could in theory provide that kind of investing but in reality they aren t great at identifying promising companies and staying nimble to help those companies grow that s where this partnership can shine it allows the european commission which is funding cutting edge research and development to partner with investors who know how to build companies well because the fund will be privately managed it can avoid some of the bureaucracy that slows things down and makes it hard to support new companies link we ll have the resources to make a meaningful difference and the flexibility to move quickly that s a rare combination i hope this partnership is just the beginning we need many more like this one around the world over the next year i will be writing a series of tgn posts about each of the five challenges focusing on some of the promising solutions i m learning about in the meantime i ve posted a short fun quiz about energy and climate link link i m inspired by the ingenious inventors who are tackling climate change and all the partners who are supporting their work i can t wait to share their progress with you
