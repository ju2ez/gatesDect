link when one seeks to prove something one does not proclaim that which he is seeking to prove at the top of his voice either in the literal or figurative sense as not only would these be inefficient it would probably cause that person who is shouting a ticket to jail for disturbing the peace the best way to prove something would be through the use of evidence and such evidence must be competent of all the evidences that one could present in order to prove something the best would probably be the official records of the government otherwise known as public records and of which link are an example link link the reason why these are the best evidence that could be presented lies in two features that these type of records have features that could not be enjoyed by other types of records for the reason that they are neither public nor official records of the government it must be noted however that public records are also limited in the sense that they could only prove that which is reflected upon their four corners this means that if the information is not written at the record being presented it cannot be presumed to exist which is the reason why a death certificate could not prove the fact of the birth of the same person who has already died link link the two features that make these records the best evidence would be the fact that these records are public records and the fact that these records are the official records public records means that these records may be requested by anyone who would make a valid request for the same and for the request to be valid one needs only to follow the procedures that are already laid down by the law the fact that these records are official records means that these records enjoy the presumption of regularity such that the party who would present these records would be under no obligation to prove that the contents of the records are the true and accurate information link link public records are available from a number of offices though note that if the law identifies a particular office as the official custodian of the records then the records would only be available from that office in general requests for copies of public records are handled at the local or county level as there would be fewer records that would have to be checked and while the method for making the request would depend on the office where the records would be requested from such methods are often to request through mail or in person link link copies of fresno county public records are also available online though note that any and all information obtained from online databases are not subject to the presumption of regularity as they are not official records nevertheless the information obtained from such databases would be substantially similar as that which may be found from the official archiveslink and they could also present the information in question faster and more efficiently link link source link from articlesfactory com family members origins can be tracked by dealing with the court records offered by a records database
