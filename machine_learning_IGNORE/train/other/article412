link window tint film is a thin film retrofit upgrade coating that can be installed to the interior of glass surfaces in automobiles boats homes and buildings in the process of window tinting heat

film are bonded together to form multilayered barrier against everything from ultra violet rays infrared rays to scratches in the process of window tinting heat rejection film is applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of infrared visible light and uv radiation that may enter through the windows link link uses of window tint filmlink window tint film has many uses which include the following uv filtration thermal insulation heat and glare reduction safety and security privacy protection from graffiti decoration increase aesthetic value signage and branding also correctly applied mirror film can create one way mirrors link link types of window tint filmlink there are many types of window tint films that are available in the market from variety of manufacturers below are the different types of window tint film according to how they are manufactured link link dyed filmslink it s also known as colored window film this is the most basic type of

added during the melting and stretching process normally there are some impact cock pit visibilities from within the vehicle but this shouldn t worry you because it will be minor due to the application of the dyed tint film on the interior side of vehicle windows the heat rejected by the film is partially stored in the glass itself and the external air movement serves to draw most of this built up heat away during normal driving this is the cheapest film available in the market link link deposited filmslink manufacturing of this type of film involves a more intricate process in which the film is drawn through a tank containing certain types of metal ingots usually nickel or aluminium the pressure in the tank is then reduced creating an artificial vacuum which is then filled with argon gas and the ingots are heated causing the metal to emit particles that move to the film surface deposition technology is relatively inexpensive and mostly used however it is limited by the types of metals that can be used in the manufacturing process resulting in a fairly restrictive product line with few options link link sputtered metallized filmslink this process is a bit more complex than deposited films sputtering is also done in a vacuum chamber the same way as in deposited film but the metalizing characteristic is achieved at the atomic level when manufacturing sputtered films electromagnetic fields argon gas or any other type of inert gas is directed towards the metal this process causes very small groups of molecules to separate from the metal and uniformly deposit onto the film unlike deposited films where very limited number of metals can be used sputtering can be done with over different types of metals this makes the process more versatile and results into much lighter and thinner coating it gives a rich color appearance which many people may appreciate metalized films are a bit more expensive that dyed films link link hybrid filmslink making of this film involves both dyed film layer and a reflective metalized layer to achieve superior results when the reflective properties of the metals and the absorption properties of the dyed films are combined less of each material is required thus resulting into a slightly lighter tint with equal or greater heat rejection than all the films discussed above link link ceramic window filmslink this is also a modern window tint film technology and a relatively new development in the industry it is the highest quality film in the market it is valued by those who appreciate true

window tint film but its advantage is that it is the most durable and it can reduce energy transmission by as much as percent it also provides a substantial increase in blocking uv rays and the ability to control heat transfer link link if you are a home owner business owner or car owner who is not sure whether to consider window tint film well here are reasons why window tint film is the
