we are sad to report that hans rosling a friend and teacher we both admired a great deal died february he was years old like many people we first became aware of hans when he gave a link in he had spent decades working in public health with a focus on poor countries and he used his talk to share some surprising facts about how life is getting better even for the world s poorest we loved his message but even more we loved the way he delivered it we weren t alone that talk has been viewed more than million times we had been trying without much luck to explain some of the same ideas and hans found a breakthrough way to make them clear and compelling he could make you laugh and get you excited about the subject while explaining something super important it was magical link later we got to know hans and his family personally and we discovered that off stage hans was pretty much the same person having dinner with him was every bit as fun and inspiring as watching him lecture in the last year of his life hans sent us a very touching letter he told us that he had cancer and then he made a request he wasn t asking for any personal favors he simply hoped that we would promise to keep spreading the message he was so passionate about that the world is making progress and that policy decisions should be grounded in data of course we were happy to make that pledge hans was a great champion for the world s poorest and for clear thinking he was also a wonderful man and we will miss him a lot link link link link link link link
