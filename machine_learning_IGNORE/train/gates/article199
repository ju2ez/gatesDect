link link we sublet our flat and moved to uganda not long after amin and obote and some really difficult times in the country nick set up a sexually transmitted disease clinic i worked in the cancer institute the two of us taught in the medical school and took care of patients we went to aids conferences and traveled to kenya ethiopia and zaire as well that lasted a little over two years eventually we transitioned the program to others came back to the united states and went into practice link i am especially impressed by the orderliness and commitment that the country of ethiopia has to health and agriculture they re making sure people get their vaccines since one of the big challenges we see in the u s medical system is all these health disparities i m particularly touched by the government s commitment to reaching people out where they live link she did say she would like it to be a little larger so that it s got more room for ice so from a very pragmatic point of view if it lasted longer than a month that would be great link link we heard moms say they don t feel like they have to have more kids because they have to have spare children just the thought of having spare children is the saddest thing on earth these moms can see with their own eyes that vaccination and maternal and child care makes that kind of impact that gives me so much optimism that the efforts of the ethiopian government are saving lives
