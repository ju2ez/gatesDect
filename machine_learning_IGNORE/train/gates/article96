even as my glasses have gotten smaller and hopefully cooler over the years i am still a proud member of nerd nation as such i read a lot of books usually more than a year many of the books i review on gates notes are recent releases because i figure people are generally more interested in hearing about newer works but i also like to revisit older books that feel especially important or relevant link by the stanford psychologist dr carol dweck is one of those books link first came to my attention a few years ago in a fascinating invention session on education with my friend nathan myhrvold similar to the sessions malcolm gladwell described in his article link dweck s research had a big impact on our thinking that day and in the years since dweck and her research have helped my foundation colleagues and me understand more about the attitudes and habits that allow some students to persevere in school despite big challenges here is dweck s thesis our genes influence our intelligence and talents link if you mistakenly believe that your capabilities derive from dna and destiny rather than practice and perseverance then you operate with what dweck calls a fixed mindset rather than a growth mindset our parents and teachers exert a big influence on which mindset we adopt and that mindset in turn has a profound impact on how we learn and which paths we take in life in experiment after experiment dweck has shown that the fixed mindset is a huge psychological roadblock regardless of whether you feel you were blessed with talent or not if you have the fixed mindset and believe you were blessed with raw talent you tend to spend a lot of time trying to validate your gift rather than cultivating it to protect your self identity as someone who s super smart or gifted you often steer clear of tough challenges that might jeopardize that identity here s how dweck puts it from the point of view of the fixed mindset effort is only for people with deficiencies if you re considered a genius a talent or a natural then you have a lot to lose effort can link you if you have the fixed mindset and believe you link the genetic lottery you also have little incentive to work hard why bother putting in a lot of effort to learn a difficult concept if you ve convinced yourself that you re lousy at it and nothing is going to alter that basic equation when i was visiting with community college students in arizona one young man said to me i m one of the people who s not good at math it kills me when i hear that kind of thing i think about how different things might have been if he had been told consistently you re very capable of learning this stuff in contrast people with the growth mindset believe that basic qualities including intelligence can be strengthened like muscles it s not that they believe that anyone can become the next albert einstein or michael jordan if they just work hard enough on their physics homework or fadeaway jumpers instead in dweck s words they believe a person s true potential is unknown and unknowable that it s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion toil and training as a result they have every incentive to take on tough challenges and seek out opportunities to improve one of the reasons i loved link is because it s solutions oriented in the book s final chapter dweck describes the workshop she and her colleagues have developed to shift students from a fixed to a growth mindset these workshops demonstrate that just learning about the growth mindset can cause a big shift in the way people think about themselves and their lives my only criticism of the book is that dweck slightly oversimplifies for her general audience contrary to the impression that dweck creates here but probably not in her academic papers most of us are not purely fixed mindset people or growth mindset people we re both when i was reading the book i realized that i have approached some things with a growth mindset like bridge while other things in a fixed mindset like basketball the greatest virtue of the book is that you can t help but ask yourself things like which areas have i always looked at through a fixed mindset lens and in what ways am i sending the wrong message to my children about mindset and effort thanks to dweck s skillful coaching you re almost guaranteed to approach these tough questions with a growth mindset
