i spend a lot of my time working to help improve america s schools i m also a big fan of ted talks so when ted s chris anderson asked me to give a talk as part of a special ted session on education i jumped at the chance you can watch my talk above and you can link john legend hosted the show and did a fantastic job john cares a lot about improving education and is investing a lot of his own time on the issue i first met him when we were both involved with the documentary link and i could tell right away that he was an impressive and well informed guy in addition to being a super talented musician it s great that he s using his fame to draw attention to the need to improve our schools link we taped the ted show last month in a beautiful hall at the brooklyn academy of music in new york city i was very impressed with the lineup of speakers one of the great things about the ted format is that it can accommodate lots of different kinds of speakers from energetic storytellers to more analytical people like me who are hardcore about numbers and systems that helps the audience look at the topic from lots of different angles in this case they had education experts like geoffrey canada who runs a terrific program called the harlem children s zone and dr angela lee duckworth whom i ve met with a few times as part of my own learning about education they also had several passionate teachers from around the country one of them a chemistry teacher named ramsey musallam startled everyone with video of himself blowing stuff up in class john brought the house down with a beautiful cover of true colors for my part i talked about what i think is the most powerful idea in education today getting teachers the feedback they deserve so they can improve their practice it s amazing to think about how much coaching is given to say professional athletes i have a coach who gives me feedback too you ll have to watch the show if you want to know why but most teachers get almost no feedback at all and the vast majority of countries that outperform us in education have some formal way to give their teachers feedback so this is an area where innovation and investment can make a big difference for teachers and students in this country as always the ted team put together a great show and i m happy to have been a part of it in the meantime here s a short video where i talk about what drives the foundation s education work the statistics on how u s schools rank internationally are really mind blowing in this video i m rehearsing a presentation about some of the most striking numbers link
