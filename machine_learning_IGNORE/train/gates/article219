here is an email chain between ed lazowska and i about the significant role that the uw s computer systems played in the early years of paul and i link link there was a wang calculator in the engineering building in the same room there was a teletype the uw had an unlimited account for logging into ccc pdp s serial numbers and which we got access to at first we just used the wang device but that became boring after awhile there was a pdp in the physics building which was by the fountain now that building is mary gates hall that pdp was almost entirely dedicated to scanning bubble chamber photos from particle accelerators including the one at stanford paul found out that it would complete its work after about hours so there were some free hours early in the morning a friend had a key to the physics building so we went up there a lot of times there was also a pdp in the medical center that we used sometimes this was the locke computer center there were several pdp s in the medical area we got to use for a few months i used a pdp that we found in the medical area and played around with a lot of decus programs and wrote most of a basic interpreter there was another set of machines in the uw computer science area in sieg hall they had an ards and an imlac so we got early exposure to the mouse and graphics stuff paul also used the sigma that was there i never programmed that machine in terms of hours the biggest usage was the pdp s at ccc but the exposure to all of the uw s machines was very helpful in thinking about various ways of programming things the people there helped us learn a lot by loaning us manuals and by looking the other way when we took os listings out of the garbage the first single board computer we did was an paul gilbert was our third partner in traf o data and he knew how to build things so he actually did the wire wrapping paul and i went to almac stroum electronics and bought the processor for it took a long time to build the machine but it actually worked the most expensive piece was the channel tape reader we had someone build for us this computer used bit memory chips if i remember correctly the wire wrapped thing looked scary
