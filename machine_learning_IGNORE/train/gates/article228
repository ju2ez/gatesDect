link one of the shorter fun books i read this summer is link it s by ed rendell who was district attorney mayor of philadelphia and then two term governor of pennsylvania if you ve heard him speak or seen him on tv you know he s a colorful and outspoken observer of political life in the u s no surprise then that this book is colorful too with lots of great stories his theme is that leaders shouldn t just tell people what they want to hear but because politics has become so intensely partisan too often our political leaders seem to be afraid to tell us the truth and to actually lead us in making the hard choices we need to face up to on issues like education reform and the federal deficit as a mayor and governor rendell faced up to some very messed up budget situations and made some smart trade offs i thought his point of view was really refreshing he makes a good point about how politics has changed in ways that make it harder for leaders to emerge and to truly lead eli broad is definitely not a wuss i enjoyed his succinct memoir link broad has had huge success in business as the leader of kb home and then sunamerica now retired he s become an important philanthropist in areas including education which is how i ve gotten to know him he attributes a lot of his success to his willingness to defy convention for example he admits he s an impatient guy who hates for people to waste his time so he won t go to any event for more than three hours he believes you may have to be unreasonable sometimes to accomplish your goals he s certainly accomplished a lot of the five books i finished over vacation the one that impressed me the most and that is probably of broadest interest is link by science writer joshua foer this is an absolutely phenomenal book that looks at memory and techniques for dramatically improving memory foer actually mastered these techniques which led him to the finals of the u s memory championship his book gives fascinating insights into how the mind works i have more to say in my separate review of link the most troubling reading i did on vacation was link by two sociologists richard arum and josipa roksa who examine the evidence on what college students actually learn i was surprised how little data there is on this important question even more disturbing the data cited by the authors indicates that students may not learn very much in their first two years of college many u s college students advance very little in important skills like critical thinking complex reasoning and writing i was really surprised to read that the data shows that students today spend much less time actually studying and they take less rigorous courses most of which don t require them to do much writing for example and yet even so many students do not complete their degrees graduation rates from u s colleges are much lower than in many other countries what s going on in higher educationis a topic i care a lot about and i basically agree with the authors findings that we have a real problem i plan to take a deeper dive into this topic with a full review of link which i ll post in a few weeks much more upbeat is link by james baraz and shoshana alexander i don t read a lot of self help or inspirational books but even if you never read anything in this genre this book is one you should try it s about enjoying your life consciously picking the things that make life more enjoyable and purposefully thinking about them it shows how to think about spirituality and purpose in your life baraz teaches a very popular course and has an online lecture series on this melinda and i actually went to one of his seminars he s a very nice guy and link is very good
