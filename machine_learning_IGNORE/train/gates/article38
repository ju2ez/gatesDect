i find anything related to abraham lincoln super interesting his personal story of someone from humble beginnings who successfully navigated the political world without compromising his beliefs is fascinating i ve read a lot about him over the years and thought i knew pretty much everything there was to know but i recently read a book about lincoln that surprised me link by george saunders gave me a new perspective on america s link president despite being a work of fiction it offered fresh insight that made me rethink parts of his life the novel takes place over the course of one night not long after the death of willie lincoln s beloved year old son the bardo in the title refers to a purgatory like place where spirits linger after death in this case a spectral version of the washington dc cemetery where willie was buried it s dangerous for children to linger in the bardo for reasons that are never explained but willie refuses to leave after his father visits his grave most of the book focuses on the other spirits trying to convince willie to depart there are spirits in total and saunders uses a script format to make it clear who is speaking when it s disorientating at first but you get the hang of it pretty quickly saunders also uses excerpts from historical texts to tell the story of willie s death and its aftermath i loved how he uses these flashbacks to show how fuzzy our recollections of the past can be in one chapter he weaves together conflicting quotes about lincoln s appearance were his eyes gray or were they green the answer changes depending on who you ask it reminded me of the musical link which deals with similar ideas about how storytellers shape history link some of the snippets in the flashbacks come from real sources like doris kearns goodwin s link and others are made uplink saunders lincoln is a man crushed by the weight of both grief and responsibility although his early life had its own share of tragedy he s now experienced the greatest heartbreak a parent can have the essential thing that which was borne that which we loved is gone he thinks as he looks down at willie s coffin toward the end of the book losing a child is unbearable for any parent but lincoln is also burdened by timing willie died less than a year after the civil war started the president has a new understanding of the grief he s creating in other families by sending their sons off to die in battle he must make a choice should the war go on if it does how can we ensure the end result justifies the cost of such suffering as far as i know there s no evidence linking lincoln s decision making in the war to his son s death but saunders cleverly makes the connection although the gettysburg address isn t mentioned in the book the results of lincoln s choice are echoed in some of its most famous lines from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain more than once while reading link i found myself wanting to discuss it with someone else a tennis buddy recommended the book to me and i couldn t wait to get back on the court and talk to him after i finished many parts of the book are intentionally mysterious the study guide at the end is helpful but i think it s more fun to hear what other people think link is heavy stuff for a summer book but i m really glad i picked it up it s a quick read thanks to its play like format and some of the ghosts stories are surprisingly funny given the subject matter if you re an abraham lincoln buff like me you won t regret taking this one on your next vacation
