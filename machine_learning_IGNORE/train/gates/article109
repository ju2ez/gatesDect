melinda picked up this novel earlier this year and she loved it so much that she kept stopping to read passages out loud to me i started it myself at p m one saturday and stayed up with it until the next morning anyone who occasionally gets overly logical will identify with the hero a genetics professor with asperger s syndrome who goes looking for a wife melinda thought i would appreciate the parts where he s a little too obsessed with optimizing his schedule she was right it s an extraordinarily clever funny and moving book about being comfortable with who you are and what you re good at i m sending copies to several friends and hope to re read it later this year this is one of the most profound novels i ve read in a long time
