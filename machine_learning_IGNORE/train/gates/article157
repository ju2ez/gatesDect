what would you say is the most dangerous animal on earth sharks snakes humans of course the answer depends on how you define dangerous personally i ve had a thing about sharks since the first time i saw link but if you re judging by how many people are killed by an animal every year then the answer isn t any of the above it s mosquitoes when it comes to killing humans no other animal even comes close take a look link what makes mosquitoes so dangerous despite their innocuous sounding name spanish for little fly they carry devastating diseases the worst is malaria which kills more than people every year another million cases incapacitate people for days at a time it threatens half of the world s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually other mosquito borne diseases include dengue fever yellow fever and encephalitis there are more than species of mosquito and mosquitoes are found in every region of the world except antarctica during the peak breeding seasons they outnumber every other animal on earth except termites and ants they were responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during the construction of the panama canal and they affect population patterns on a grand scale in many malarial zones the disease drives people inland and away from the coast where the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes considering their impact you might expect mosquitoes to get more attention than they do sharks kill fewer than a dozen people every year and in the u s they get a week dedicated to them on tv every year mosquitoes kill times as many people but if there s a tv channel that features mosquito week i haven t heard about it that s why we re having mosquito week on the gates notes everything i m posting this week is dedicated to this deadly creature you can learn about my recent trip to indonesia to see an ingenious way to combat dengue fever by link somehow this story involved me offering up my bare arm to a cage full of hungry mosquitoes so they could feed on my blood you can read a harrowing account of link and link who s fighting it and i ve shared link where i saw some fascinating work that could point the way to eradicating malaria which would be one of the greatest accomplishments in health ever i hope you ll have a look around i can t promise that link will be quite as exciting as hammerheads and great whites but maybe you ll come away with a new appreciation for these flying masters of mayhem link
