i read a lot but i don t always choose what s on the bestseller list many of the books i read this year actually came out years ago that s why this post isn t called the best books of you may notice that there aren t any novels on my list this year it s not that i don t enjoy fiction i ve read link a bunch of times it s one of my favorite books ever and i enjoyed link the documentary that came out this year i did read gary shteyngart s link which was entertaining though it didn t have as much science fiction as i expected but i read mostly nonfiction because i always want to learn more about how the world works and reading is how i learn best each of the books on the list below taught me something i didn t know how shipping containers helped cut the cost of moving goods between asia and north america by roughly half how refined tools for measurement laid the groundwork for the invention of the steam engine how we re dangerously overfishing cod tuna and other species more generally these books tell amazing stories of human ingenuity it is this ingenuity that helps explain why the world keeps getting better and why at the end of each year i look forward to the next one with hope and optimism here are my picks in no particular order along with a link to my full review if i wrote one
