it is amazing how many lifesaving tools you can carry on your back i was meeting with dr raj panjabi and he was showing me one of the backpacks created by link the nonprofit he co founded in liberia raj reached into the bag and took out a vial of medicine to treat pneumonia next he pulled out rapid test kits for malaria and hiv then rehydration salts for children with diarrhea a measuring tape to screen kids for malnutrition a thermometer to check for fevers a blood pressure cuff and so on it was like watching a magician pull rabbits out of a hat link the backpack is a key part of last mile health s effort to deliver basic health care to people who live beyond the reach of the health system raj was born in liberia and fled the civil war there with his family when he was when he returned as a medical student years later he was shocked to learn that there were only doctors for a country of million people so he and his co founders set out to recruit train and equip a cadre of community health workers who would provide a range of basic services in remote areas of liberia thanks to last mile health more than trained workers now serve people in two of liberia s most far flung counties these are community members raj told me who may have a middle school to a high school education and can be trained and equipped to provide high impact medical care just within a matter of weeks our foundation helps fund some of their work other countries use community health workers too i ve written before link link and will be posting soon about rwanda s but last mile health is putting some clever twists on the idea for example they re on the cutting edge when it comes to using digital tools their staff use smartphones to collect data about their work with patients which helps identify health trends and improve the program they re also developing a training platform where you could watch video lessons on say how to vaccinate children or hear a podcast on how to distribute bednets and then take a quiz to test your understanding ultimately there s no getting around the need for a primary health care system with well stocked clinics and staff community health workers are a good complement to a functional primary health care system and a step in the right direction for places that don t yet have one like liberia as raj says no one should die simply because they live too far from a doctor it s great to see him and his colleagues trying to make that idea a reality we need more passionate innovators like them
