if you re looking for something to read this summer i d recommend any of the books below i read them all earlier this year and think each one is terrific only one link qualifies as a typical beach read but all six are deeply informative and beautifully written link warren buffett recommended this book to me back in and it s still the best business book i ve ever read even though brooks wrote more than four decades ago he offers sharp insights into timeless fundamentals of business like the challenge of building a large organization hiring people with the right skills and listening to customers feedback he is also a masterful storyteller peppering his articles with compelling portraits of everyone from general electric executives to the founder of piggly wiggly groceries his article on the fate of the ford motor company s edsel is a classic link is out of print in hardcover and paperback but you can now buy it in e book form and you can link i wish all business writing were half as good link link the central irony of link is that a guy who was accused of being a lousy communicator as u s treasury secretary has penned a book that is such a good read geithner paints a compelling human portrait of what it was like to be fighting a global financial meltdown while at the same time fighting critics inside and outside the administration as well as his own severe guilt over his near total absence from his family the politics of fighting financial crises will always be ugly but it helps if the public knows a little more about the subject what s at stake what the options are what has worked in similar situations so that the loud talkers resonate a bit less and the knowledgeable ones a bit more if link continues to attract lay readers it could make at least a modest difference the next time around link link link i read a lot about teddy roosevelt last year around the time melinda and i took our kids to the panama canal he was instrumental in getting the canal built and i d assumed it was the highlight of his career but it wasn t it s a testament to the breadth and depth of roosevelt s accomplishments that the canal warrants only a handful of mentions in this biography there s just too much other fascinating material competing for space from roosevelt s relationship with the press and his friendship with william howard taft who was brilliant in his own right to his efforts to fight corruption and reform the political system i m especially interested in the central question that goodwin raises how does social change happen can it be driven by a single inspirational leader or do other factors have to lay the groundwork first sometimes a single leader can make a big difference in the field of global health link almost singlehandedly created a global constituency for children sparking a movement to double vaccination rates and save millions of lives but roosevelt s case was different although he tried to push through a number of political reforms earlier in his career he wasn t really successful until journalists at link and other publications had rallied public support for change i loved goodwin s link and highly recommend this one too link melinda picked up this novel earlier this year and she loved it so much that she kept stopping to read passages to me i started it myself at p m one saturday and stayed up with it until the next morning anyone who occasionally gets overly logical will identify with the hero a genetics professor with asperger s syndrome who goes looking for a wife melinda thought i would appreciate the parts where he s a little too obsessed with optimizing his schedule she was right it s a funny and profound book about being comfortable with who you are and what you re good at i m sending copies to several friends and hope to re read it later this year it is one of the most enjoyable novels i ve read in a long time link link climate change is a big problem one of the biggest we ll face this century but it s not the only environmental concern on the horizon humans are putting down massive amounts of pavement moving species around the planet over fishing and acidifying the oceans changing the chemical composition of rivers and more natural scientists posit that there have been five extinction events in the earth s history think of the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs and kolbert makes a compelling case that human activity is leading to the sixth unlike a lot of people who write about the environment kolbert doesn t resort to hype she just lays out the facts and wraps them in memorable anecdotes it s a sobering but engaging and informative read link one of the architects of the affordable care act a k a obamacare makes the case for why the u s health care system needed reform and how obamacare sets out to fix the problems although he was deeply involved in its creation emanuel is good about making it clear when he s educating you about the history of health care and when he s advocating for his ideas he calls out a few things he disagreed with in obamacare like the creation of a separate health insurance exchange for small businesses and unlike a lot of experts he s willing to make predictions about how health care will change in the coming years some day we ll be able to look back and see whether he was right the facts and history that emanuel lays out would be useful to anyone involved in the debate over health care no matter what their point of view is
