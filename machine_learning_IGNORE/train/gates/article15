mosquitoes keep me up at night if you ask someone about what things scare people the most there s a list of usual suspects shark attacks heights enclosed spaces etc mosquitoes usually don t make the cut but they frighten me more than almost anything else this fear might be a bit irrational in seattle where i live our climate is too mild for the types of mosquitoes that harbor serious diseases in other parts of the world however families have good reason to be afraid mosquitoes and the diseases they carry kill more than half a million people every year consider this mind blowing statistic link of all the illnesses mosquitoes spread malaria is the worst by far more than million people suffer from it every year and a child dies from malaria every other minute of every day if you survive it can leave you vulnerable to other debilitating diseases and chronic anemia it s an awful painful disease i link link a couple years ago melinda and i encounter a lot of suffering through our work but one of the worst things i ve ever seen is a child having seizures from cerebral malaria in tanzania i will never forget watching his small body twist in agony as his parents waited to find out if he would survive i wouldn t wish that experience on anyone so why exactly are people more afraid of sharks than mosquitoes the late hans rosling would argue that humans are hardwired to fear things that cause us physical harm this instinct is practical if you live in poverty on link link where an animal attack is more likely to kill you but if you can afford life saving healthcare it can distort your perception of how significant a threat really is even if you know that you re times more likely to get killed by a mosquito than a shark human instinct wins out a photo of a shark attack victim on the evening news evokes a visceral reaction because the threat is obvious a picture of a malaria victim in a hospital ward doesn t trigger our fear instinct in the same way despite this i m determined to spread the word about mosquitoes which is why i m bringing back mosquito week here on gates notes everything i m posting this week is dedicated to my least favorite pest you can link link about a country that hopes to eliminate malaria by you can link link the mozambique ministry of health and world vision distributed last year on behalf of the gates notes insider community are making a difference i m going to be talking about mosquitoes on my social channels all week and i hope you ll join the conversation as long as hollywood keeps making link i ll keep talking about why everyone should be more scared of a tiny bug than a pound carnivore jaws is nothing compared with the flying terror that is a mosquito
