when i was in my s and early s i was fanatical about software by fanatical i mean that i was so focused on my vision of putting a computer on every desk and in every home that i gave up a normal existence i didn t take vacations or weekends off i wasn t interested in getting married obviously that changed when i met melinda my colleagues and i at microsoft took tremendous pride in being the first to arrive at work and the last to leave it was an incredibly fun chapter of my life now much of my work involves learning from other fanatics they are the scientists in search of new vaccines teachers working tirelessly to perfect their craft engineers dreaming up crazy ideas for new sources for clean energy being able to learn about their work and help them realize their dreams has opened up an amazing new chapter in my life looking back over i had the opportunity to meet with many gifted individuals trying to change the world their hard work and dedication fuel my optimism that our world s best days are still ahead of us here are a few of my favorite fanatics i hope they inspire you just as much as they have me this fall melinda and i were lucky enough to go to plains georgia and spend an evening with jimmy and rosalynn carter at jimmy carter hasn t slowed down for most being president of the united states would be the high point of their public lives for jimmy carter it was just the start of a long career dedicated to human rights causes he s won the united nations human rights prize and the nobel peace prize he started the carter center which continues to work on improving the health of the poorest including ending guinea worm he s an author i just read his book link link a strikingly honest memoir about his private and public life he continues to teach as well every month he and rosalynn go to emory university where he lectures in the departments of global health political science theology and holds open q a sessions with students at home he keeps busy too during a tour of his home jimmy showed melinda and me how he spent the last few years rebuilding the house himself he also shared some paintings he s done in his spare time his life should be an inspiration to all of us one of my favorite new phrases i learned in is nerd farmer that s how nate bowling washington state teacher of the year described his role in the classroom i joke about being a nerd farmer i m trying to cultivate a kind of scholarship in students and a passion for learning so i bring passion to the classroom and they see that and rise to the occasion he told me during link in june nate teaches ap government and ap human geography at lincoln high school in tacoma half its students are african american or hispanic and more than percent are eligible for free or reduced price lunch many students at high poverty schools like lincoln struggle and do not graduate ready for college or high paying jobs thanks to nate and his colleagues lincoln is bucking that trend it has a graduation rate of percent above the average for washington schools with similar demographics and percent of its students are taking advanced placement ap classes nate is a great example of what it takes to be an effective teacher he works hard at his craft always searching for ways to make a subject relevant for his students for example he uses link to help explain civil rights it s pretty amazing all kids can learn if they have the support he says during my visit to india in november i had a chance to catch up with nandan nilekani one of india s best known entrepreneurs philanthropists and thinkers we met more than years ago when he was helping to start infosys a technology and consulting corporation i was impressed with him then and continue to be amazed by how he has lent his entrepreneurial passion to philanthropy and public service in he left infosys to serve as the chairman of india s new identity card system aadhar which has provided biometric ids to more than one billion people now nandan is dreaming up ways to use this platform to help improve the lives of the world s poorest he and his wife rohini have set up ekstep a non profit that uses smartphone based apps to help children with early learning nandan and i share a common optimism about the potential of the digital revolution in india to improve lives through access to savings accounts health records and education we had a link with the link during my visit and to learn more about nandan s vision for india s future you can read his book link we are much better off dreaming taking risks and trying to realize a billion aspirations at best we risk falling flat on our faces he writes far more egregious and most dangerous to our country is going about business as usual leaving a billion voices unheard and a billion frustrations unresolved link link there s an african proverb often cited at our foundation if you want to go quickly go alone if you want to go far go together that was the vision behind dr ana mari cauce s incredible effort at the university of washington this year to unite researchers and resources from the university and beyond to help improve the health and well being of people around the world dr cauce the president of the university of washington saw the need to help the university s medical school school of public health the institute for health metrics and evaluation environmental scientists and dozens of other partners to collaborate together more effectively around common health related goals the effort called the link has incredible potential to unlock the power of health research and data for the benefit of all being truly healthy means far more than simply being free from ailments and afflictions when we assess health we must also take into account the many other factors that affect well being poverty discrimination climate change and violence to name just a few dr cauce said during her announcement of the initiative in october our foundation awarded a million grant to the university to fund the construction of a new building to house the initiative and help foster greater collaboration i m eager to see what this visionary effort will mean for improving health worldwide i spent a lot of time in meeting with some amazing scientists and researchers on topics ranging from malaria to microbes in the field of energy one of my best teachers has been ken caldeira a climate scientist at the carnegie institution for science ken investigates issues related to climate carbon and energy systems his official job title requires him to make important scientific discoveries and he has he is a pioneer in exploring the impact of human activity on our climate his experiments have given us the strongest evidence to date that ocean acidification is already harming coral reef growth i first met ken a decade ago and we ve met a few times each year for learning sessions about climate change and energy he s a brilliant teacher who is always patient when i ask lots of questions what i appreciate most about his teaching style is how he is able to explain complex ideas in ways that are accessible to anyone you can see this at work on link where he uses the challenge of managing his office s shared coffee pot as a way to explain how we could fight climate change we will not solve the climate problem by teaching people to be less selfish he writes if we have to wait until people learn to make self sacrificing snap judgments before we can solve the climate problem we will be waiting until it is too late
