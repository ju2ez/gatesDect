if somebody asked me what do you think your decades of working in technology have prepared you for my first answer definitely wouldn t be writing a best selling novel that beautifully explores the human condition but australian author graeme simsion has taken his extensive experience in the data modeling industry and used it to do just that melinda and i loved his first book link it starts when a geneticist who may or may not have asperger s syndrome decides to put together a double sided page questionnaire as the obvious first step to finding a wife ultimately the book is less about genetics or thinking too logically or the main character s hilarious journey than it is about getting inside the mind and heart of someone a lot of people see as odd and discovering that he isn t really that different from anybody else since then i must have given link to at least friends graeme has been busy too writing a sequel called link as soon as we heard about it melinda and i asked him for an advance copy and we enjoyed it so much that we invited graeme to come to seattle to talk to us about it i was happy to learn that one of my favorite things about both books is also one of graeme s favorite things usually when we meet people who are different from us in whatever way we tend to treat them as inferior even though we say that s not what we re doing we may not even consciously realize we re doing it but through don tillman the hero of both books graeme casts the issue in a different light true don may not be the best at picking up on subtle social cues but if you need to secretly collect dna samples from people at a party there s nobody in the world who s going to do a better job different doesn t mean less than what don allows readers to appreciate is that just because somebody might not be highly literate in the link of emotions doesn t mean he doesn t link emotions and powerful ones at that he sees the world in terms of logic but he feels just as deeply about that world as everybody else that puts him in a difficult position and graeme puts you right there with him link the second book shows that graeme isn t a one trick pony it s got a lot of the same characters and of course they have the same foibles as they did in the first book they even find themselves in some of the same kinds of situations but somehow graeme manages to make everything look and feel totally new don does aikido in the first book and so when you get to aikido in the second book you think is this just going to be the same thing again but then it turns out to be funny in a completely different way link which will be released in the united states at the end of the year improves on its predecessor in one interesting way in the first book you won t necessarily see yourself in don i d say most readers will see somebody they link in him but not necessarily themselves anybody who s a parent though has experienced what don goes through in the second book link or link these are powerful fears we all have and seeing them in don makes you feel like you re not the only one and the outlandish plot at one point don decides the most logical thing to do is to have a new york accountant pretend to be an italian peasant pretending to be a columbia medical student makes it impossible not to laugh at it all graeme says that his comedy mentor s mantra is make em laugh make em cry make em think i think that with link and link graeme has written two books that would make his mentor proud
