link future market insights has announced the addition of the artificial lift systems market global industry analysis and opportunity assessment report to their offering the recovery of hydrocarbon resources from the reservoir occurs either through natural bottomhole pressure or by creating artificial pressure using artificial lift systems the artificial lift systems market is expected to witness a moderate annual growth in coming years owing to strengthening of crude oil prices according to energy international agency eia brent crude is anticipated to be traded at around per bbl by the end of further the mature fields account for over of the global oil gas production with recovery in prices of the global crude oil benchmarks coupled with attempts to increase production from mature fields the global artificial lift systems market is expected to witness increased revenues in coming years although a number of enhanced oil recovery eor techniques are available for increasing the amount of hydrocarbon recovery but they are considered as tertiary recovery system the artificial lift system on the other hand is a primary recovery technique which provides low cost and effective means of maintaining the desired production rate in a well an artificial lift system is utilized to overcome bottom hole pressure during the phase when natural bottomhole pressure is not enough to support the flow of hydrocarbons from reservoir to the well bore the artificial lift system enables to overcome downhole pressure in order to maintain the desired production rate from a producing well request free report sample link artificial lift systems market segmentationthe global artificial lift systems market has been segment on the basis of geography as well as on the basis of actuation mode used for artificial lift system on the basis of actuation mode the global artificial lift systems market has been segmented into pump assisted artificial lift system and gas assisted artificial lift system the pump assisted artificial lift systems market has been further divided into four different systems which include rod pump hydraulic piston system electrical submersible pump esp and progressive cavity pump further the gas assisted artificial lift system has been further segmented into two different types of systems gas lift and plunger lift within the artificial lift systems market rod pump has been the oldest types of methods that has been used across the industry however other artificial lift systems are expected to gain traction in the global artificial lift systems market in coming years in terms of geography the global artificial lift system has been segmented into seven key geographical regions which include north america latin america western europe eastern europe asia pacific excluding japan middle east africa japan the artificial lift system has witnessed a larger market share in terms of revenue as compared to other regions across the globe increasing mature fields in regions such as middle east is expected to drive the market for artificial lift systems through the forecast period visit for toc link artificial lift systems market market driversthe industry s inclination and attempts to optimize upstream assets is one of the key drivers for the global artificial lift systems market additionally the recovery in crude oil price after recent plummeting is also likely to drive investments in global artificial lift systems market the desire to maintain the production rate in a well in addition to the cost effectiveness an artificial lift system provides as compared to tertiary recovery techniques the artificial lift systems market is expected to witness increased revenue generation in years to come artificial lift systems market key playersthe global artificial lift systems market witnessed key players such as baker hughes dover artificial lift flotek industries inc halliburton company kudu industries schlumberger ltd weatherford internationallink among others full report analysis link source link from articlesfactory com future market insights corporate way suite valley cottage new york united statestel fax email link website link
