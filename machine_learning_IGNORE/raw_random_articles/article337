link one of the most important functions of any government institution is the release of information to the public and it typically would not even matter what kind of information it would be as long as it is something that is related to the functions of the government and there is just the slightest chance that the public would be interested in the records the records made by the government are called public records and an example of the same would be link which is an all encompassing term that would include even vital records link link although in general all records of the government are supposed to be available to the public there are some records that would contain some information that are considered to be too confidential and too sensitive for ordinary people to see the law acknowledges that there is sometimes a need to keep certain information from the people even if the people would be very interested in the same when the law does this it is not because it is seeking to hide the records from the public it is just that the law acknowledges that there are some information that should not be made available to the general public at the other end of the spectrum would be public records which are supposed to be available to the public at all times link link public records are the best source of information and in this regard their classification as public records gives up two very important advantages the first would be the fact that they are available to the public at all times and for whatever reason though do note that there are still some procedure that must be followed when requesting for the records the second would be the fact that public records are afforded great respect when it comes to their contents such that a person who would claim that the contents of the records are false would have the burden of proving such allegation link link now public records are available from a number of offices though there are some that would only be available at certain offices in accordance with the law in general to request for public records the person interested in the records would have to make his or her request in person at the office where the records are being kept although this may require some travel time do note that requests made in person are actually faster and more efficient because the records requested for would be made available at the same day that they are requested precluding the need to actually make multiple trips or to wait for the records to be sent via mail to the home address of the person making the request link link it is also possible to access baker county court records public access online through the use of online database faster more efficient and considerably cheaper to use than the official sources these online databases could present substantially the same information but note that they are not official sourceslink so they could not be used as references in official proceedings article tags link link link link link source link from articlesfactory com public records search online is designed to experience a quicker approach in acquiring public records they can be sought after with proper authorized authorization
