misunderstood method the implications of bankruptcy are usually misconstructed by the overall public and there are lots of false data regarding bankruptcy that s accepted as truth also the link is misunderstood and people in a country are afraid to consider a lawyer because of the myths and misconception that still exists here i will bring some common topics that are myths and that you shouldn t at all believe let me tell you the truth that the above statement is wholly a false statement people wouldn t know anything about your bankruptcy filing until and unless you re are somewhat reputed or famous in the area the only people knowing about your situation would be the creditors and some people whom you may by chance say about it even though bankruptcy is a matter of publics records the files are so massive that it is very difficult to get someone a sound notice about it no one can come to know about the matter until the time it s not investigated or tracked down which is a quite far step as talking about initial ones that rarely happens as my suggestion try to avoid talking about it with your friends or neighbors at least till the time it s not cleared and it would be benefiting you yourself as it will help you in not being the talk topic for everyone you can share it with some whom you feel you should or some close near and dear ones who wouldn t just reveal any such information other than you to anybody else false even though laws vary from state to state each state has exemptions that defend bound forms of property at constant time filing bankruptcy doesn t typically wipe out or get obviate mortgages or liens against your property therefore if you wish to purchase an automobile truck home or business equipment that is collateral for a loan you need to keep paying on the debt if you create these payments and have exemptions to hide any worth higher than what s owed you can rest assured you ll be able to keep these things filing for chapter bankruptcy offers people the chance to retain their property within the rare circumstance that they are doing not to qualify for accessible exemptions in these instances you need to continue creating payments on your debt so as to stay with your property a practiced bankruptcy lawyer will assist you to confirm which kind of bankruptcy is correct for you while most of you might feel that bankruptcy will never give you the ability to own new assets the statement is completely wrong because bankruptcy is intended by the jurisdiction to individuals to have a fresh start that includes the future ability to purchase own any asset like car house firm etc once you are legally discharged in your bankruptcy you become no longer responsible for any debts and you are allowed to hold any possession you want there are no such laws that prohibit you or any individual to hold any ownership of houses automobiles goods etc the statements are quite the contrary to what is true in other words it is a total false statement filing bankruptcy gets obviate certain debts getting rid of certain debts frees up cash to a higher lookout of your family releasing up cash to a higher lookout for your family
