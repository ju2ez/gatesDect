link semantic search is the future of enterprise search and is all set to revolutionize our interactions with the search platforms this article looks into its benefits along with a few examples of new age platforms that have successfully implemented it what is semantic search it s the technology that uses artificial intelligence ai to comprehend the user s intent behind every search query and also the context of the query so even if the user types in a query with minor typos or spelling errors it tries to get into the mind of the user to understand what he was probably thinking and what results he seeks with this additional information it can help you get far more accurate results that are highly relevant to the users of your enterprise search tool as compared to the results provided by a platform that works on keyword based search search analytics data indicate that it has resulted in improved user interactions with search platforms here we shall take a closer look at the ways in which it has redefined the enterprise search experience an intuitive approach to searchgone are the days when users had to try out different keywords and their variations in order to find something relevant to what they were looking for the introduction of semantic search has changed the game and how the new age enterprise search platforms allow you to go ahead and type in a few words and it s likely that you ll get the results you seek a good example is link typo tolerance algorithms that can detect typos in a search query and show relevant results access to quality contentwith the need to type several different combinations of keywords gone for good users can quickly access quality content thus it becomes easier to find the right content in the shortest time the clustering and semantic cloud features of link are good examples of how users can quickly get relevant results heightened user experienceenhanced user experience is just another advantage of semantic search as indicated by search analytics the use of artificial intelligence ai brings an intuitive element to the search experience and adds to the convenience of a well designed user interface ui the highly reliable error free scalable and automated enterprise search platforms including open source semantic search engines such as link have taken the user experience to an all new level effective content integrationanother advantage is understanding the intent behind the search query and showing results with synonyms and related terms thus users have access to information that was non accessible through the traditional keyword based search it also makes content integration more effective as users have access to information that was not accessible through the traditional keyword search so we can safely conclude that semantic search has immense potential to redefine the way we approach enterprise search the fact that search engine giant google has over the recent years focussed on evolving as a semantic search enginelink is a testimony to how it is indeed the future of search article tags link link link link link link link source link from articlesfactory com elise lowry is a technical writer and a web entrepreneur with many years of experience she regularly blogs about rising it companies path breaking it solutions current it trends and much more understanding how technology affects the world we live in is her subject of interest
