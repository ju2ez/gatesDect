for years i ve been saying steven pinker s link was the best book i d read in a decade if i could recommend just one book for anyone to pick up that was it pinker uses meticulous research to argue that we are living in the most peaceful time in human history i d never seen such a clear explanation of progress i m going to stop talking up link so much because pinker has managed to top himself his new book link is even better link takes the approach he uses in link to track violence throughout history and applies it to different measures of progress like quality of life knowledge and safety the result is a holistic picture of how and why the world is getting better it s like link on steroids pinker was generous enough to send me an early copy even though link won t be released until the end of february i read the book slowly since i loved it so much but i think most people will find it a quick and accessible read he manages to share a ton of information in a way that s compelling memorable and easy to digest it opens with an argument in favor of returning to the ideals of the enlightenment an era when reason science and humanism were touted as the highest virtues gates notes insiders can get a preview of this section of the book i m all for more reason science and humanism but what i found most interesting were the chapters exploring each measure of progress pinker is at his best when he analyzes historic trends and uses data to put the past into context i was already familiar with a lot of the information he shares especially about health and energy but he understands each subject so deeply that he s able to articulate his case in a way that feels fresh and new i love how he s willing to dive deep into primary data sources and pull out unexpected signs of progress i tend to point to things like dramatic reductions in poverty and childhood deaths because i think they re such a good measure of how we re doing as a society pinker covers those areas but he also looks at more obscure topics here are five of my favorite facts from the book that show how the world is improving pinker also tackles the disconnect between actual progress and the perception of progress link link people all over the world are living longer healthier and happier lives so why do so many think things are getting worse why do we gloss over positive news stories and fixate on the negative ones he does a good job explaining why we re drawn to pessimism and how that instinct influences our approach to the world although i wish he went more in depth about the psychology especially since he s a psychologist by training the late hans rosling explains this more fully in his excellent new book link which i plan to review soon i agree with pinker on most areas but i think he s a bit too optimistic about artificial intelligence he s quick to dismiss the idea of robots overthrowing their human creators while i don t think we re in danger of a link style scenario the question underlying that fear who exactly controls the robots is a valid one we re not there yet but at some point who has ai and who controls it will be an important issue for global institutions to address the big questions surrounding automation are proof that progress can be a messy sticky thing but that doesn t mean we re headed in the wrong direction at the end of link pinker argues that we will never have a perfect world and it would be dangerous to seek one but there is no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing the world link getting better even if it doesn t always feel that way i m glad we have brilliant thinkers like steven pinker to help us see the big picture link is not only the best book pinker s ever written it s my new favorite book of all time
