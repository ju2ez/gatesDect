many books i ve read about entrepreneurs follow a common and i believe misleading storyline it goes like this a sharp entrepreneur gets a world changing idea develops a clear business strategy recruits a crack team of partners and together they rocket to fame and riches reading these accounts i m always struck by how they make their achievements appear to be the inevitable result of some great prescience or unusual skill it s no wonder publishers churn out how to titles packed with tidy checklists step programs and other simplistic recipes for entrepreneurial success link phil knight s memoir about creating nike is a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like it s a messy perilous and chaotic journey riddled with mistakes endless struggles and sacrifice in fact the only thing that seems inevitable in page after page of knight s story is that his company will end in failure failure of course is about the last thing people would associate with nike today the company s sales top billion and nike s swoosh is one of the most universally recognized logos across the globe walk down almost any street in the world and you ll likely find someone wearing a pair of nikes but knight brings readers back more than years to the incredibly humble and fragile beginnings of the company when he started selling imported japanese athletic footwear out of the back of his plymouth valiant i ve met knight a few times over the years he s super nice but also very quiet like many other people who ve met him i found him difficult to get to know as famous as his company has become knight was a mystery among fortune executives in the pages of link however knight opens up in a way few ceos are willing to do he s incredibly tough on himself and his failings he doesn t fit the mold of the bold dashing entrepreneur he s shy introverted and often insecure he s given to nervous ticks snapping rubber bands on his wrist and hugging himself when stressed in business negotiations it took him weeks to tell penny the woman who would become his wife that he liked her and yet in spite of or perhaps because of his unusual character traits he was able to realize the crazy idea as he calls it to do something different with his life and create his own shoe company knight s interest in shoes started at the university of oregon where he ran track for legendary running coach bill bowerman he then went to stanford for his mba where he wrote a paper about the potential market for importing japanese athletic shoes to the u s at the time japanese cameras were making a dent in the german dominated camera market why not do the same with japanese running shoes which he thought could compete against leading german athletic shoe makers adidas and puma so far this storyline may feel familiar it s the myth of the young entrepreneur with a world changing idea who is headed down a straight path to success but the rest of knight s journey rips that myth to shreds much of the suspense in the book is built by the precarious nature of knight s finances he started his shoe import business known then as blue ribbon sports with from his father it was the beginning of many years of living in debt year after year he goes on his knees to his bankers to beg for more credit so he could import more japanese shoes he rarely had any savings in the bank because he would plow all of his profits back into the company to order more shoes from japan even as sales of his shoes took off his business was constantly on life support meanwhile he had a rocky relationship with his japanese shoe supplier whose executives were constantly eyeing other potential u s partners despite knight s success selling and helping to improve the designs of their shoes eventually knight broke away and started nike beginning another round of uncertainty knight is amazingly honest about the accidental nature of his company s success consider the famous nike swoosh he paid an art student to design it but he didn t recognize what a special logo it would become it ll have to do he said at the time the decision to call the company nike was also not knight s top choice he wanted to name it dimension six but his employees pushed him to choose nike at the time knight agreed but he was not convinced maybe it will grow on us he said when i was starting microsoft i was fortunate enough that i was entering a business that didn t have such tight margins i didn t struggle with banks to get financing as knight did i also didn t need to struggle with the large factories which i wish knight spent more time explaining after reading close to pages about the shoe business i was disappointed that i didn t learn more about what it takes to manufacture an athletic shoe what are all the parts of the shoe which ones are difficult to manufacture and why what i identified most with from his story were the odd mix of employees knight pulled together to help him start his company among them a former track star paralyzed after a boating accident an overweight accountant and a salesman who obsessively wrote letters to knight to which knight never responded they were not the people you would expect to represent a sportswear company it reminded me of my very early days at microsoft like knight we pulled together a group of people with weird sets of skills they were problem solvers and people who shared a common passion to make the company a success we all worked hard but it was also lots and lots of fun readers looking for a lesson from knight s book may leave this book disappointed i don t think knight sets out to teach the reader anything there are no tips or checklists instead knight accomplishes something better he tells his story as honestly as he can it s an amazing tale it s real and you ll understand in the final pages why despite all of the hardships he experienced along the way knight says god how i wish i could relive the whole thing
