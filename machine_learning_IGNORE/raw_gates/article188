link it s easy to say and i don t know anyone who would disagree with the sentiment but in the history of american education this vision has proven hard to deliver on whenever i talk to teachers one of their biggest concerns is that they don t have the tools they need to do their best work we see the same results in polls of teachers i m optimistic that all of us who are passionate about education can solve this problem one of the main reasons i m so hopeful is that advances in technology will make it easier to give teachers the support they deserve for example teachers will be able to upload videos of themselves and get advice from their peers watch the best teachers in the world at work and get real time feedback from their students software will also help identify which students are having trouble and adjust for their own learning style leaving teachers more time to focus on the kids who need extra personal attention i wrote in more detail about how software will improve education worldwide link developers will play a key role in making these advances i recently had a chance to talk with a number of the leading companies doing this work when i spoke at the link an education technology conference in san diego california i encouraged them to work more closely with teachers to understand their needs and to make sure their products deliver measurable results in the classroom technology can revolutionize the way teachers and students work together but only if we base our approaches on evidence about what works below you can read the transcript of my onstage q a i also link there s a lot of exciting work going on in this field and i definitely left san diego feeling better than ever about the potential for technology to support teachers and students in a big way link link link link link link well in the k area the way the products are selected the way money is budgeted for those over time that s really got to change we ve got to free up more of the professional development money we ve got to get some example products that are clearly so successful that it really opens peoples minds to what the role of technology here is i d say we re pretty early in that process there are a lot of teachers who are willing to be the pioneers in this area that s where we ve gotten the adoptions so far there are a lot of cases where we try and go beyond and get a district wide adoption we really have to look at why the uptake by the actual usage isn t quite there because then that creates something that other people hear about and they re very very reluctant we do have the benefit though the digital tools now with the combination of pc tablet and cell phone the three of those we re close to universality the idea that the connection was holding things back or access to a device is holding things back those haven t gone away but particularly if some of the experience can be done on a small screen then even when you get outside the united states the access levels are starting to be a lot higher there s a very positive framework there s a sense of need you know as people look at those college residence numbers they look at those completion numbers and the whole cost equation higher education is really staring at a tough set of constraints so that should serve to drive the demand link link link well personalized learning is a fairly clear definition but i think there are different things that come under that umbrella math is the most straightforward because the idea of assessing knowledge very efficiently and saying ok if you really can answer those questions then we ll move on to the other area that s far more concrete than say writing or history i was pretty amazed in my last visit to summit to see how they have taken all the different areas and really given the students a sense of some degree of choice in what they re doing and a real sense of what they need to get done the idea of an agency where the student knows how much they have to get done they re making some selections there that really creates a different relationship between the student and teacher so i m hopeful that for math we can get a very broad rollout of that within the next five years it does require the schools to be open minded because when you go to those new classrooms locations they re not just in a typical classroom they ve been allowed to remodel some of that space so the kids are moving around and it s quite amazing but there was an upfront investment there and a decision to get all the teachers engaged in that new model it s a lot easier if you can do the current physical classroom teacher by teacher some stuff fits into that but the biggest impact is where you can make changes in those things as well it s a school wide way of doing things as you get up into higher ed it s a lot more straightforward because then there s an assumption that largely the student is motivated the student knows what they re doing and it is there in higher ed the interactivity the personalization particularly in the remedial courses where we ve gone the furthest that we ve seen a dramatic payback in link link link yes i think virtual reality can make things more engaging and there are certain things where you have more of a sense even if you can t say build a car in the virtual world you can sit there and put the pieces together and almost feel like you re doing far more than would be practical in the real world there s a lot of pedagogy about understanding the science and the math principles that really won t change much just because we put it in a virtual reality framework school is always about motivation the material has been in the textbooks for a long time in some subject areas it hasn t even changed that much if we can use it to draw people in then that s incredibly valuable i m just starting this for some of the videos i do like where i go out to a refugee camp or to a developing country to actually make a virtual reality movie so people actually have a sense so they can see what it was like and look around and feel it and yes we see it as we re creating those early stage things we see a lot of engagement and so combining that with the underlying concepts and not just having it be a distraction in learning science there are a lot of things about you make things too animated too colorful things like that it often distracts from what you re really trying to get done which is the attention to a few basic concepts so i m sure we ll be able to abuse virtual reality as well as we have any new technology that s out there i do think in terms of design lots of engineering things there s lots of places where it will play a practical role and hopefully draw people in and the cost particularly where you re just taking the cellphone and repurposing that we won t have to wait a whole decade before the accessibility is there for the lower end versions of this the higher end versions having an environment where you spend the and have it as a shared device we should have that in a lot of locations as well link link link well it s been very interesting to learn about who online learning is working for and so far a lot of the people who are engaged online are more of these adult students who are tougher because their scheduling is more difficult but they re easier because they come back for a reason that is they re self selected that ok i want to become a nurse i want to get this engineering degree and so online because it fits into that time flexibility and because they re willing to persevere that s been the initial audience that that s worked well for but there are people now including asu who are using it for other cohorts and they re taking the very latest which is far more engaging content than we ve had in the past and trying to make it work for everyone i think in education there s two types of visits you can do when you get discouraged and don t think that anything can happen then you ve got to go visit kipp or green dot or high tech high or summit and see classrooms or rocket ship which actually is doing some very interesting things go to one where it all really came together great teachers a new approach and you get reminded wow if we could do this for every student this would be phenomenal then if you ever think oh boy this is great then go and visit a college that has a percent completion rate or go to an inner city high school and get a sense of the disengagement that s there and the amount of resources that s just going to make sure that the environment is secure and so we have plenty of opportunity to see both of those i do more visits to the ones that are doing well because those are the best practices we want to spread my most recent trip this fall was to appalachia and i thought that would be a mix but because kentucky has invested in their schools over the last years what we saw was mostly uplifting these are public schools very low income kids and the way those communities have come together around some of the new curriculum better professional development was really inspiring so that gives you maybe a year or two of motivation you need to do it even more
