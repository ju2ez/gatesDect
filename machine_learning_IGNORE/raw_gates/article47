link when i started my career as a teacher looking out at my classroom of eager teenagers i never imagined how far beyond my classroom i would have to reach in order to have a deeper impact on my students and my profession i certainly never imagined that taking a position as a theatre and communications teacher in rural texas would eventually lead me to teaching recent immigrant and refugee students in spokane washington and being named the national teacher of the year as a new teacher i worried over what i would teach each day whether it would be engaging for my students whether they would learn something in my class and whether i could build their confidence and impact them enough to propel them toward success it wasn t until i started teaching in bronx new york that i witnessed many of the negative impacts that our schools courts and health care systems have on students of color and i began to see the need to expand beyond my classroom those early years in my career when i only focused on my classroom were a luxury one we should afford all new teachers however once that foundation is built we must open our doors and inform policies at the local state and federal level this is how we make a more lasting impact on our profession our school systems and the students we serve in my tenure as the washington state teacher of the year and now the national teacher of the year i have had the chance to explore education in my state and across the nation i ve taken a leave from my classroom in order to learn from my colleagues and to see how different states and districts are serving students i ve met with teachers administrators state and federal lawmakers education advocates and others i have seen dedicated educators who put students first unfortunately i have also seen rigid educational systems that have forgotten their paramount purpose to serve the individual needs of the students this often takes the form of standardized instruction pacing guides and the push to follow scripted curriculum with fidelity as a year veteran educator i can attest that teaching looks different year to year and classroom to classroom no two teachers have the same students so they should be able to serve their students in different ways that means having the time and latitude to get to know their students and plan instruction to reach the goals we have set the same can be said for the system in general each school district and each school within that district should have flexibility within their systems to meet the specific needs of their communities that s why educators need to be engaged in making policy not just at the federal and state level but at the local level too local rules generally dictate what actually occurs in our classrooms and in my experience it s also where educators are most often left out policies about recess are a good example in in response to a new federal law intended to fight childhood obesity washington state issued a set of guidelines on wellness how much physical education students should get what might constitute active recess and so on but each school interpreted the guidelines differently some had up to minutes of recess a day while others had virtually none the variation depended a lot on the socio economic level of the neighborhood the more affluent the neighborhood the more time their students spent in recess educators in the seattle school district saw the disparity and came together to fix it they helped develop a new policy all neighborhood schools whether they re in a wealthy neighborhood or a low income one must allow for minutes of unstructured recess every day this is a prime example of how educators can use their experience to impact local policy i encourage my fellow educators to follow education policy know how federal and state policies impact your classroom school and community and take an active role in implementing those policies policymakers please invite teachers in seek their input as the people who interact with students every day we know what is best for them in the classroom and we must lead not only in carrying out policies but in developing them in the first place
