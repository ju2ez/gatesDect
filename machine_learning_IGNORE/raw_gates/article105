not long after i first met warren buffett back in i asked him to recommend his favorite book about business he didn t miss a beat it s link by john brooks he said i ll send you my copy i was intrigued i had never heard of link or john brooks today more than two decades after warren lent it to me and more than four decades after it was first published link remains the best business book i ve ever read john brooks is still my favorite business writer and warren if you re reading this i still have your copy a skeptic might wonder how this out of print collection of link articles from the s could have anything to say about business today after all in when brooks profiled xerox the company s top of the line copier weighed pounds cost required a full time operator and came with a fire extinguisher because of its tendency to overheat a lot has changed since then it s certainly true that many of the particulars of business have changed but the fundamentals have not brooks s deeper insights about business are just as relevant today as they were back then in terms of its longevity link stands alongside benjamin graham s link the book that warren says is the best book on investing that he has ever read brooks grew up in new jersey during the depression attended princeton university where he roomed with future secretary of state george shultz and after serving in world war ii turned to journalism with dreams of becoming a novelist in addition to his magazine work he published a handful of books only some of which are still in print he died in as the journalist michael lewis wrote in his foreword to brooks s book link even when brooks got things wrong at least he got them wrong in an interesting way unlike a lot of today s business writers brooks didn t boil his work down into pat how to lessons or simplistic explanations for success how many times have you read that some company is taking off because they give their employees free lunch you won t find any listicles in his work brooks wrote long articles that frame an issue explore it in depth introduce a few compelling characters and show how things went for them in one called the impacted philosophers he uses a case of price fixing at general electric to explore miscommunication sometimes intentional miscommunication up and down the corporate ladder it was he writes a breakdown in intramural communication so drastic as to make the building of the tower of babel seem a triumph of organizational rapport in the fate of the edsel he refutes the popular explanations for why ford s flagship car was such a historic flop it wasn t because the car was overly poll tested it was because ford s executives only pretended to be acting on what the polls said although the edsel was supposed to be advertised and otherwise promoted strictly on the basis of preferences expressed in polls some old fashioned snake oil selling methods intuitive rather than scientific crept in it certainly didn t help that the first edsels were delivered with oil leaks sticking hoods trunks that wouldn t open and push buttons that couldn t be budged with a hammer one of brooks s most instructive stories is xerox xerox xerox xerox the headline alone belongs in the journalism hall of fame the example of xerox is one that everyone in the tech industry should study starting in the early s the company funded a huge amount of r d that wasn t directly related to copiers including research that led to ethernet networks and the first graphical user interface the look you know today as windows or os x but because xerox executives didn t think these ideas fit their core business they chose not to turn them into marketable products others stepped in and went to market with products based on the research that xerox had done both apple and microsoft for example drew on xerox s work on graphical user interfaces i know i m not alone in seeing this decision as a mistake on xerox s part i was certainly determined to avoid it at microsoft i pushed hard to make sure that we kept thinking big about the opportunities created by our research in areas like computer vision and speech recognition many other journalists have written about xerox but brooks s article tells an important part of the company s early story he shows how it was built on original outside the box thinking which makes it all the more surprising that as xerox matured it would miss out on unconventional ideas developed by its own researchers brooks was also a masterful storyteller he could craft a page turner like the last great corner about the man who founded the piggly wiggly grocery chain and his attempt to foil investors intent on shorting his company s stock i couldn t wait to see how things turned out for him here s a spoiler not well other times you can almost hear brooks chuckling as he tells some absurd story there s a passage in the fate of the edsel in which a pr man for ford organizes a fashion show for the wives of newspaper reporters the host of the fashion show turns out to be a female impersonator which might seem edgy today but would have been scandalous for a major american corporation in brooks notes that the reporters wives were able to give their husbands an extra paragraph or two for their stories brooks s work is a great reminder that the rules for running a strong business and creating value haven t changed for one thing there s an essential human factor in every business endeavor it doesn t matter if you have a perfect product production plan and marketing pitch you ll still need the right people to lead and implement those plans that is a lesson you learn quickly in business and i ve been reminded of it at every step of my career first at microsoft and now at the foundation which people are you going to back do their roles fit their abilities do they have both the iq and eq to succeed warren is famous for this approach at berkshire hathaway where he buys great businesses run by wonderful managers and then gets out of the way link is as much about the strengths and weaknesses of leaders in challenging circumstances as it is about the particulars of one business or another in that sense it is still relevant not despite its age but because of it john brooks s work is really about human nature which is why it has stood the test of time
