this presidential election has the country captivated as many commentators have pointed out the primaries are more focused on personalities than policy while the parties focus on who is going to represent them in the fall i want to make the case for something that i hope every candidate will agree on in november america s unparalleled capacity for innovation when the united states invests in innovation it creates companies and jobs at home makes americans healthier and safer and saves lives and fights poverty in the world s poorest countries it offers the next president a tremendous opportunity to help people in america and around the world of course america s capacity for innovation is nothing new we have been inventing for more than two centuries think of benjamin franklin margaret knight thomas edison by the end of world war ii the united states led the world in automobiles aerospace electronics medicine and other areas nor is the formula for success complicated government funding for our world class research institutions produces the new technologies that american entrepreneurs take to market what is new is that more countries than ever are competing for global leadership and they know the value of innovation since south korea s r d spending measured as a percentage of gdp has gone up percent china s has doubled the united states has essentially flatlined it s great that the rest of the world is committing more but if the u s is going to maintain its leading role it needs to up its game i have seen first hand the impact that this type of research can have i was lucky enough to be a student when computers came along in the s at first they were very expensive so it was hard to get access to them but the microchip revolution made possible by u s government research completely changed that among other things it enabled microsoft the company i co founded to write software that made computers an invaluable tool for productivity later the internet another product of federal research changed the game again it is no accident that today most of the top tech companies are still based in the united states and their advances will have a massive impact in every area of human activity my favorite example is health america s investment in this area creates high paying jobs at universities biotech companies and government labs it leads to new treatments for disease such as cancer therapies it helps contain deadly epidemics like ebola and zika and it saves lives in poor countries since the fraction of children who die before age has fallen by more than half i think that s the greatest statistic of all time and the united states deserves a lot of credit for making it happen the next few years could bring even more progress with a little luck we could eradicate polio a goal that is within reach because of vaccines developed by u s scientists polio would be the second disease ever eradicated after smallpox in in which the u s also played an irreplaceable role there is also exciting progress on malaria the number of deaths dropped more than percent from to thanks in part to america s support for breakthrough tools like drugs and bed nets but to make the most of these opportunities we need to invest more in basic health research and specific areas like vaccines energy is another great example american funded research defines the state of the art in energy production early advances in wind and solar technology were developed with federal money and this research offers a strong return on investment between and the department of energy spent billion in today s dollars on research on efficiency and fossil fuels yielding billion in economic benefits yet until this year the doe s research budget hadn t seen a real increase since the reagan administration if we step up these investments we can create new jobs in the energy sector and develop the technologies that will power the world while also fighting climate change promoting energy independence and providing affordable energy for the billion poor people who don t have it today some of the more promising areas include making fuel from solar energy much the way plants do making nuclear energy safer and more affordable capturing and storing carbon and creating new ways to store energy that let us make the most of renewables there s a lot of momentum right now on clean energy research last year the leaders of countries including the united states committed to double federal investments in this area complementing that crucial effort i helped launch the breakthrough energy coalition a group of private investors who will back promising clean energy companies the next president will have a chance to accelerate this momentum investing in r d isn t about the government picking winners and losers the markets will do that it s about doing what we know works making limited and targeted investments to lay a foundation for america s entrepreneurs this approach has been fundamental to u s leadership for decades and it will become only more important in the years ahead by the end of this summer the political parties will have chosen their leaders and will start looking ahead to the november election the nominees will lay out their vision for america and their agenda for achieving it these visions will probably have more differences than similarities but i hope we can all agree that no matter how you see america s future there will always be an essential role for innovation link link
