there can t be many days that are less popular than april but i want to remind you of a fact that might ease the pain the income taxes you re paying will save lives in poor countries if your family makes the u s median household income of roughly together you will buy someone in a poor country about seven months worth of hiv treatment or provide a lifesaving vaccine for children or buy eight bednets that will protect people from mosquitoes that cause malaria i got these numbers from link created by the one campaign which is worth checking out it assumes your income taxes are spent in the same proportion as the u s federal budget these numbers might make you wonder if a large portion of your income taxes goes to foreign aid after all seven months of aids treatment can t be cheap you wouldn t be alone in wondering this polls show that americans tend to think nearly a quarter of the budget goes to aid it turns out that foreign aid is just percent of the federal budget or about billion a year another way to think about it is that just percent of your income taxes goes to foreign aid compare that to other items in the budget defense for example is percent or more than out of the median household s income tax bill i believe that if more people knew what a small share of the budget goes to these programs and how effective these programs are at saving lives they d want to do even more april will never be anyone s idea of a fun day but i hope it helps to remember how much good american aid is doing around the world
