search the web for what it feels like to have malaria and you will find a lot of harrowing descriptions link an especially gripping one i awoke to what felt like lightning going through my legs and then spreading through my body and in my head probably the worst headache body aches and chills you could possibly imagine it felt like i was being stung repeatedly by an electric shock gun and could barely control my movements the pain was so intense i actually believed i was dying literally crying out in pain so bad that i was taken to a hour clinic that night at am imagine feeling like that and trying to go to school work or take care of your family it would be impossible it s no surprise that economic growth in countries with severe malaria is significantly lower than in countries without it even after accounting for other factors as the economists jeffrey sachs and john luke gallup have written the only parts of africa free of malaria are the northern and southern extremes which have the richest countries on the continent malaria is far from the only cause of poverty but it is a significant one link whenever someone asks me why we should fight malaria i have a simple answer because it kills so many people more than every year and it leaves so many more people too sick to function which holds back the world s poorest from making the most of their lives malaria is gone from the united states and europe but where it is still a problem few diseases do more to limit human potential this may all sound hopeless but i m actually optimistic that we can eventually eradicate malaria i wrote about why link i hope you ll take a look
