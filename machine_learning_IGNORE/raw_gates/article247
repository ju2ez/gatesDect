like a lot of people i link on my head a few weeks ago to call attention to the disease als i soon got the chance to learn more about it in a very inspiring way shortly after i made the ice bucket video i heard that steve gleason a former pro football player who was diagnosed with als in was visiting the seattle area he stopped by my office recently to talk about the disease and to show me how he uses technology to break through some of the barriers it creates it was really impressive to see how he overcomes the challenges of having als you may know about steve from the link he made with microsoft this year or from the link that espn did on his friendship with the guys in pearl jam als which gradually destroys the brain s ability to control any of the body s muscles has robbed him of the ability to walk move his limbs speak or breathe on his own steve hasn t lost an ounce of his intellect or personality but he is trapped inside his own body his wife michel told me the als community calls it being locked in steve said that for als patients the right support and the right technology are key to living a productive life today his window on the world is a tablet computer a microsoft surface pro working in tandem with an eye tracking device made by tobii the eyes i learned are usually some of the last muscles to be affected by als just by looking at different areas of the surface steve can pull up an on screen keyboard open apps drag and drop icons scroll and more he can write e mails watch videos tweet and post to facebook during our meeting steve used this setup to write comments that were spoken aloud by a speech synthesizer at one point we all laughed as he had fun making the voice speed up and slow down to ridiculous levels he also asked me to name a song and then quickly used spotify to pull up my favorite things from link it was the john coltrane version link steve thinks the hardware and software can get even better which is what brought him to seattle he s working with microsoft to develop various ideas that they hope will one day benefit lots of als patients for example they re looking at ways to control a wheelchair using the surface right now steve needs someone else to steer his chair they re also trying to improve the predictive text part of the software which guesses what word he s writing steve hopes it will one day be so accurate that he ll be able to carry on a real time conversation with his wife steve has a smart way of looking at the fight against als in the short medium and long term the short term goal is to help people with als now steve and michel s foundation link raises money to buy tablets with eye tracking equipment which cost around each for patients who can t afford them they also help patients take trips across the united states and around the world another way of breaking through that locked in feeling the medium term work is to continue improving the technology for als patients our intention steve told me is to create a mechanism to fast track the development of innovative products to transform as many lives in as short a time frame as possible the long term project steve said is to find a cure he would like to see more money focused on research and also more coordinated use of that funding last year team gleason hosted a summit in new orleans where patients advocates doctors and researchers began work on a link for harmonizing efforts toward a cure als is so complex it has to be approached like the original moon shot steve told me explaining the five year plan president kennedy did not ask for more studies on how to get to the moon he empowered a large scale collaborative and goal oriented initiative to land on the moon steve and his team are doing great work i m really glad i got the chance to meet him and learn more about als the ice bucket challenge made a lot of people more aware of this disease and i hope we ll eventually be able to look back on it as a key moment in the fight against als
