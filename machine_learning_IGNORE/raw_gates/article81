the year melinda and i started our foundation president bill clinton convened in the white house some of the world s great scientists to announce a huge milestone for humanity two rival efforts one led by the national institutes of health and the other by a private company had completed the first draft of the human genome map without a doubt link this is the most important most wondrous map ever produced by humankind fast forward years with little public fanfare geneticists have reached another super important milestone while the human genome map gave us the ability to link all three billion letters of our genetic code we now have the power to link the human genome as well thanks in part to a chance discovery by researchers working to improve yogurt scientists can now enter human cells selectively snip out sections of code and then incorporate new sequences permanently in the genome scientists have now launched early stage clinical trials with these new genome editing tools these tools are generating a ton of optimism for diagnosing treating and curing human disease even before researchers successfully complete clinical trials in humans genome editing will be put to good use in link and animals all of which holds big promise for our foundation s work to alleviate hunger and improve health in poor countries although i am excited about these advances we have to approach them with caution it s one thing to reprogram the code that runs our computers reprogramming the code that runs our species is a very different thing altogether as with any powerful new technology genome editing will be attractive to people with both good intentions reducing human suffering and bad causing it even just with respect to the former the ethical questions are enormous that is why i am so glad i read link by columbia university cancer doctor and researcher siddhartha mukherjee and recently had a chance to chat with him in person he is the perfect person to guide us through the past present and future of genome science i loved link and his brilliant book about cancer link which won the pulitzer prize in it must really tick off full time writers that a doctor can win a pulitzer in his spare time in link mukherjee once again shows his gift for making hard science easily accessible he wrote this book for general audiences because he knows that it s not good enough for scientists alone to debate the huge ethical questions that their discoveries provoke as he emphasized repeatedly in our conversation determining the proper rules and boundaries for these technologies requires broad public discussion debate and consensus mukherjee makes link accessible in a variety of ways like all good science writers he offers creative metaphors to explain difficult concepts he is also a beautiful storyteller he uses that talent to weave in his own family s history of mental illness which i found incredibly touching and through stories he introduces us to the key pioneers in genetics from gregor mendel who repeatedly failed the exam to teach high school science but later ushered in the modern science of genetics to francis collins the devout christian motorcycle enthusiast who brilliantly led the public effort to sequence the human genome my favorite part of the book was the final section post genome the genetics of fate and future it does a great job bringing into sharp focus the difficult ethical questions that will become increasingly intense within years it will be possible for clinicians to use genome editing to help people with diseases caused by a single faulty gene such as cystic fibrosis an unquestionably ethical use of this new technology but what about making the repair in egg or sperm cells to save people from developing these diseases later in life this form of therapy could be highly effective but it would mean that children born from these sperm or eggs link altering the human germ line and crossing an ethical rubicon altering the human germ line is not just a hypothetical possibility teams of researchers in china are racing to do so in human embryos while these researchers are using link embryos a swedish developmental biologist link that he is editing healthy viable human embryos he says he will not let the edited embryos develop past days but there s no telling what other scientists may be planning by the time this book is published the first post genomic human might be on his or her way to being born mukherjee reports as i read link i came up with long lists of ethical questions of my own for example what if a prenatal test told you with a high degree of certainty that your child will have an iq of unless you do this little edit what if a private ivf clinic offered its patients a little enhancement to their fertilized embryos to boost children s likely iq from high to very high this could exacerbate inequities that are already a big problem especially if this technology is available only for wealthy people what about a series of edits that could dramatically reduce the incidence of disorders on the autism spectrum wouldn t that mean reducing human diversity in dangerous ways perhaps even eliminating the possibility of a future alan turing the brilliant computer pioneer who helped break germany s enigma code during world war ii technology is amoral it is neither good nor bad it is up to all of us not just scientists government officials and people fortunate enough to lead foundations to think hard about these new technologies and how they should and should not be used reading link will get you the point where you can actively engage in that debate
