in the early days of microsoft i felt pretty confident about my coding skills but i had a lot to learn about project management this became abundantly clear after an incident in when i told intel a really important customer that we would deliver them a version of microsoft basic in four weeks they thought i was crazy to promise it that fast and it turned out that they were right we were two weeks late as it happens intel employed someone who would end up helping me improve my management skills andy grove a precise hard driving guy andy oversaw their strategy and operations and he championed the idea of management by objective andy and i became friendly over the years i studied several of the business books he wrote early on and microsoft adopted some of the methods that intel used i consider andy one of the great business leaders of the link century andy s ideas are a basis for the management system called okrs objectives and key results developed by john doerr a venture capitalist and a frequent business partner of mine in his new book link john explains how okrs work and shows how you can apply them in all sorts of situations i d recommend john s book for anyone interested in becoming a better manager and i d say that even if i hadn t been interviewed for a super nice chapter about the gates foundation in the excerpt below john tells the inside story of how andy inspired the idea of okrs link link link link intel was grove s laboratory for management innovation he loved to teach and the company reaped the benefits a few days after getting hired i received a coveted invitation to intel s organization philosophy and economics course known as iopec a seminar on intel strategy and operations resident professor dr andy grove in the space of an hour grove traced the company s history year by year he summarized intel s core pursuits a profit margin twice the industry norm market leadership in any product line it entered the creation of challenging jobs and growth opportunities for employees fair enough i thought though i d heard similar things at business school then he said something that left a lasting impression on me link he referenced his previous company fairchild where he d first met robert noyce and gordon moore and went on to blaze a trail in silicon wafer research fairchild was the industry s gold standard but it had one great flaw a lack of achievement orientation expertise was very much valued there andy explained that is why people got hired that s why people got promoted their effectiveness at translating that knowledge into actual results was kind of shrugged off at intel he went on we tend to be exactly the opposite it almost doesn t matter what you know it s what you can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish that tends to be valued here hence the company s slogan intel delivers link to claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all important well i wouldn t learn link at harvard i found the proposition thrilling a real world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials but grove wasn t finished and he had saved the best for last over a few closing minutes he outlined a system he d begun to install in when intel was three years old link it was my first exposure to the art of formal goal setting i was mesmerized a few unvarnished excerpts straight from the father of okrs now the two key phrases are objectives and the key result and they match the two purposes the objective is the direction we want to dominate the mid range microcomputer component business that s an objective that s where we re going to go key results for this quarter win ten new designs for the is one key result it s a milestone the two are not the same the key result has to be measurable but at the end you can look and without any arguments did i do that or did i not do it yes no simple no judgments in it now did we dominate the mid range microcomputer business that s for us to argue in the years to come but over the next quarter we ll know whether we ve won ten new designs or not it was a very very simple system grove said knowing simplicity was catnip to an audience of engineers on its face the conception seemed logical commonsensical and inspiring against the stale management orthodoxy of the period grove had created something fresh and original strictly speaking however his objectives and key results did not spring from the void the process had a precursor in finding his way grove had followed the trail of a legendary vienna born gadfly the first great modern business management thinker peter drucker link link link
