reflecting on my recent trip to india i m really quite optimistic about the country s future in fact if you look at the kinds of things that are going well such as partnerships between the government and ngos that focus on a common purpose india is really a microcosm of the world the kinds of advances we see there especially in health will over time extend to even the poorest countries i m always excited to see where india is going and this recent trip reminded me again why the people and the country are so special
