never before have i felt so empowered to learn as i do today when i was young there were few options to learn on my own my parents had a set of world book encyclopedias which i read through in alphabetical order but there were no online courses video lectures or podcasts to introduce me to new ideas and thinkers as we have today still reading books is my favorite way to learn about a new topic i ve been reading about a book a week on average since i was a kid even when my schedule is out of control i carve out a lot of time for reading if you re looking for a book to enjoy over the holidays here are some of my favorites from this year they cover an eclectic mix of topics from tennis to tennis shoes genomics to great leadership they re all very well written and they all dropped me down a rabbit hole of unexpected insights and pleasures link by david foster wallace this book has nothing to do with physics but its title will make you look super smart if you re reading it on a train or plane link is a collection of five of wallace s best essays on tennis a sport i gave up in my microsoft days and am once again pursuing with a passion you don t have to play or even watch tennis to love this book the late author wielded a pen as skillfully as roger federer wields a tennis racket here as in his other brilliant works wallace found mind blowing ways of bending language like a metal spoon link by phil knight this memoir by the co founder of nike is a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like messy precarious and riddled with mistakes i ve met knight a few times over the years he s super nice but he s also quiet and difficult to get to know here knight opens up in a way few ceos are willing to do i don t think knight sets out to teach the reader anything instead he accomplishes something better he tells his story as honestly as he can it s an amazing tale link by siddhartha mukherjee doctors are deemed a triple threat when they take care of patients teach medical students and conduct research mukherjee who does all of these things at columbia university is a quadruple threat because he s also a pulitzer prize winning author in his latest book mukherjee guides us through the past present and future of genome science with a special focus on huge ethical questions that the latest and greatest genome technologies provoke mukherjee wrote this book for a lay audience because he knows that the new genome technologies are at the cusp of affecting us all in profound ways link by archie brown this year s fierce election battle prompted me to pick up this book by an oxford university scholar who has studied political leadership good bad and ugly for more than years brown shows that the leaders who make the biggest contributions to history and humanity generally are not the ones we perceive to be strong leaders instead they tend to be the ones who collaborate delegate and negotiate and recognize that no one person can or should have all the answers brown could not have predicted how resonant his book would become in honorable mention link by gretchen bakke this book about our aging electrical grid fits in one of my favorite genres books about mundane stuff that are actually fascinating part of the reason i find this topic fascinating is because my first job in high school was writing software for the entity that controls the power grid in the northwest but even if you have never given a moment s thought to how electricity reaches your outlets i think this book would convince you that the electrical grid is one of the greatest engineering wonders of the modern world i think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex and so critical for building our clean energy future
