we re spending twice as much on education today as we did years ago yet u s students ranked link in science link in math and link in reading in the latest data from the link oecd the most widely used global assessment of student achievement who s beating the u s in these important categories and how vivien stewart in her book link looks at five countries singapore canada finland china and australia where students are doing significantly better on global assessments than students in the u s despite differences in the political systems and cultural contexts of these countries there are some common policies and practices that drive success understanding how other countries are succeeding can offer insights that help us do a better job here in the u s as stewart points out even a small improvement in the skills of a nation s labor force can have a big impact on its economy in a global market where companies can find well educated workers in a growing number of countries often at lower cost the u s will face greater competition if this trend continues finland is an interesting example because as recently as only percent of finnish adults held a high school diploma today its students rank among the top on global assessments of student learning one key to finland s success was the decision in to require a two year master s degree for all teachers even those teaching primary school teachers are trained to spot students who aren t doing well early on and each school has a multidisciplinary team of education professionals available to support students and help them catch up finland also did away with traditional structure and replaced it with a more flexible approach that encourages creativity and problem solving individualized learning and a wider range of academic and vocational options the modernization of finland s education system has helped put it in the ranks of the most innovative and prosperous countries per capita gdp in finland is higher than in the united kingdom france or japan and teaching is a much sought after profession that is held in high regard like finland singapore decided that its future lay in tapping its human capital in the singapore system all the key elements work closely together to produce continuous improvement over the last decade singapore has introduced innovative and flexible learning choices for students it even has a policy called teach less learn more that s designed to encourage more innovative curricula and use of classroom time singapore also is investing significantly in teachers with strong teacher evaluation and personnel systems and intensive training with all this it s not really a surprise that singapore s students rank near the top in international assessments or that its per capita gdp is higher than the u s canada or most countries in europe i agree with stewart that the quality of student learning is only as good as the quality of the teachers in the u s it will require investing in strong evaluation and development systems that involve teachers from the start include multiple measures of effective teaching and that fuse teacher evaluations with high quality professional development i recommend this book as a good overview of what other countries are doing although i would have liked to see more data for example the book spends very little time on the length of the school day or school year which many people think are key factors in educational achievement and it doesn t explain how the u s manages to spend so much on education without having smaller class sizes or higher teacher pay all in all it s an interesting view into five countries which are making remarkable educational progress and that offer lessons for us in the u s
