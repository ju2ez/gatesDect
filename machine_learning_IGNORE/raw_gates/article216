you re probably seeing a lot of people s year end lists right now going through the best movies books youtube clips grumpy cat memes etc i thought i would share a different kind of list some of the good news you might have missed i ve limited my list to global health and development where melinda and i spend a lot of time but even so there s a lot to report if you measure progress by the number of children who die of preventable causes or by the number of people who escape extreme poverty as i do then was definitely a good year for example link you may have heard about recent polio outbreaks in syria kenya and somalia what you may not know is just how rapid and effective the response has been it looks like the outbreak in the horn of africa was controlled in months less than half the time it took to control an outbreak there in that speed is due in part to the work done at the link held inlink abu dhabi this year in the past the world has had to make tough trade offs between responding to outbreaks improving routine immunization and fighting the disease in the last three countries where polio is still circulating afghanistan pakistan and nigeria there was no coordinated plan or long term funding for doing all three at once at the summit the world got both we adopted a comprehensive plan for pursuing all three goals including making the world polio free by and more than donors including a number of very generous link backed the plan with a total of billion in long term funding that means we won t have to make those trade offs anymore it s a huge step forward there s also great news from india in early india will have gone three years without a single polio case assuming no new ones are reported between now and then that s a testament to the fantastic job they ve done immunizing every child even in the most remote parts of the country now they re focused on keeping the disease from coming back next door in pakistan the political leaders are clearly resolved to get polio out of the country once and for all when i met prime minister nawaz sharif this fall he made it clear that he sees vaccinating children as a matter of justice despite the ongoing violence there and in afghanistan including horrifying reprisals against vaccine workers the next couple of years are a good opportunity for us to make progress on this goal link one of the yearly reports i keep an eye out for is link the title doesn t sound especially uplifting but the report shows amazing progress for example half as many children died in as in that s the biggest decline ever recorded and hardly anyone knows about it if you want to learn more and i d urge you to the report has a good at a glance summary on page link if you want to read just one article that explains the state of the world s poor and the future of the fight against poverty check out link which the link ran in june it gives a short but thorough overview of the progress so far the poverty rate has dropped by half since and the prospects for keeping it going as the article says the biggest factor in reducing poverty over the past few decades has been economic growth growth that touches not just those who are already rich but a broad range of people we ll need to maintain this growth in the coming decades to keep the poverty numbers coming down that s one reason i argue for stepping up our investments on health health may not cause growth directly but it does help lay the foundation for it i never miss an issue of the link and this might be the best piece they ran this year link just this month donors met in washington d c to renew their funding commitments to the link i was there and i got to meet connie mudenda a zambian woman living with hiv who started getting treatment in thanks to the global fund the medicine she takes costs just cents a day and it helped her get healthy go back to work and support her family connie says that a decade ago she d often see people who were so sick with aids that they couldn t even walk a family member would push them down the street in a wheelbarrow today though link the country s economy is growing and connie says the wheelbarrows have vanished there s a terrible catch in global health you need new tools to fight diseases but if you can t pay to deliver them they don t get made and if they don t get made then no one gives money to deliver them so it s fantastic that donors are stepping up to avoid this problem by making big commitments to the global fund link that shows what a massive impact the fund has had link if you love data and if you re curious about what causes the most suffering around the world you should check out the link web site which was launched early this year the foundation helped pay for it personally i am a yes on both categories which is why i have spent a lot of time on there it lets you make beautiful charts that help you understand the impact of disease in different countries and even see how things change over time link i should say how grateful i am to everyone who made time to meet with me from world leaders to health workers in india nigeria pakistan and around the globe some of these workers take great risks to help people facing attacks from extremists in order to vaccinate children they are true global health heroes link next year i m excited about the continued rollout of a vaccine called link because it prevents five diseases next year it will be available in south sudan the last of the poorest countries to introduce it india just announced that they ll start giving it to every child in the nation in if other countries follow india s example pentavalent could prevent million deaths by next up are new vaccines to prevent pneumonia and rotavirus which causes diarrhea and we re seeing more middle income countries like china and india develop the ability to manufacture vaccines which drives the cost down crucial to delivering all these vaccines is link an alliance that has helped million children get immunized since go back and read that again link next year gavi will be asking donors to renew their commitments just as the global fund did this year it will be a challenge to raise more money but i know from experience that people want to help kids get vaccinated when they see what a phenomenal impact it has it s hard to resist the thrill of helping to save the life of a single child let alone millions one last note about i ll be publishing my sixth annual letter in january this time i m planning to take a slightly different tack from years past melinda and i will be tackling some of the biggest myths we encounter in our work on health and poverty it should be a fun one to write if you d like to get an e mail notice when the letter is out you can link
