link link at the age of i was an established tennis player with a first grand slam title in my pocketlink the way to becoming number in the world but just having professional success wasn t enough this was the moment i asked myself how do i want to develop on a personal level i knew i wanted to support children living in poverty by starting my own foundation from a very young age i had the deep wish to give back to people who are less privileged than i am my mother comes from south africa and i grew up seeing extreme poverty firsthand during holidays spent in that region visiting family i became aware at an early age that not all children enjoyed the same privileges i had growing up in a rich country like switzerland that s why i founded the roger federer foundation in beginning an exciting and educational journey i quickly realized that becoming a good philanthropist isn t easy the will to give back is not enough on its own in the foundation s early years we were less rigorous about what we funded and we quickly realized that we couldn t measure whether we were having an impact or not if we really wanted to change children s lives in a tangible and sustainable way we needed to go about it in a much more professional and strategic manner we had to assess how we could most effectively help children break the cycle of poverty as well as nurture their potential one of the best ways to achieve this is by focusing on education the roger federer foundation has therefore concentrated its investments on improving the quality of education in existing educational institutions for children aged to in southern africa and switzerland it s been nearly years since i created my foundation and i ve learned a lot about philanthropy since then the first lesson i learned was that empowerment is crucial if you want to change things in a sustainable manner when i visit our programs in rural africa i am always inspired to see how incredibly strong and committed the local population is in the middle of one of the poorest regions in the world mothers do everything to provide school meals for the children every day and fathers build new classrooms where their children can learn and perform better beneficiaries must always be in the driver s seat to take responsibility in every initiative my foundation concentrates on mobilizing and empowering local communities to initiate a process that increases the quality of education through mentorship they can start to understand that a better future lies in their own hands and that through a joint effort they can achieve sustainable change i ve also learned that there is no simple recipe for success in philanthropy and that success does not come automatically achieving sustainable change is complex and depends on many external factors challenges and risks it demands time flexibility and expertise you need to understand dynamics on the ground and react to threats and opportunities this is why we closely collaborate with local partner organizations and why we established a regional office in south africa we are constantly learning and doing our best to adapt our programs accordingly philanthropy like tennis demands time and discipline we follow a strict system of checks and balances and an effective project management cycle transparency measurability and evaluation of our engagement are also fundamental and we try to achieve all this in the most cost efficient manner more than percent of the foundation s expenditures flow into the countries and programs and this is a metric that we are extremely proud of sooner or later the moment will come when my tennis career is done and i have more time to spend with my foundation i definitely look forward to being able to travel more often to africa visit our programs and raise more money for our cause link becoming a good philanthropist is a never ending journey
