dr denis mukwege is founder of panzi hospital in the democratic republic of congo where he and his staff have cared for more than survivors of sexual violence they include women who have been raped in front of their families and girls brutally assaulted by combatants during the country s two decades of civil war some of his patients are infants less than one year old who have been raped for someone who has witnessed so much cruelty and suffering dr mukwege could be forgiven for not having a very hopeful view of our world but when i met him in new york last year i was struck not only by his warmth and gentleness but also his incredible optimism what is keeping me going is really the strength of women i discovered how women are strong how women can rebuild and give hope for our humanity he told me they have taught me a lot about how we can make our world better by not only thinking about yourself but to think about other people as a boy growing up in eastern zaire now the democratic republic of congo dr mukwege was drawn to a life of service to others he would accompany his father a pastor as he went from home to home to pray for the sick in their community while he admired his father s faith he wanted to use the power of medicine to help heal them at age he decided he would become a doctor he went to medical school in france where he specialized in pediatrics as he learned about how many women were dying giving childbirth especially in his own country he switched to obstetrics when he returned to africa he opened a center to provide maternity care in the city of bukavu in eastern congo it was the first clinic of its kind in the entire region but the first patient he saw didn t come because she was pregnant she had been raped and shot in the months that followed dozens more rape survivors showed up at his hospital by year s end dr mukwege had treated hundreds of survivors and their numbers kept growing he soon learned that rape was being used by soldiers to intimidate and displace entire communities causing the women and their families to flee when rape is used as a weapon of war the impact is not only to destroy women physically it s also to destroy their minds to destroy their humanity he said link at first dr mukwege focused on treating the women s physical wounds but he soon realized that it was not enough most of the women had been so traumatized that they could not go back home and restart their lives so he designed a more comprehensive approach to care that goes beyond physical healing and focuses on psychological support and socioeconomic assistance he also started a legal program to pursue justice for the survivors of sexual violence looking back over the thousands of patients he s seen over the years dr mukwege says one case stands out for him it s the first patient he treated more than two decades ago she underwent six surgeries and at first was unable to walk she thought her life was ruined he recalled but she was inspired to help others who had experienced what she had she enrolled in school and dedicated her life to taking care of other victims of sexual violence today she is one of the longest serving employees at panzi hospital where she helps patients put the pieces of their lives back together thanks to her efforts and the work by the rest of dr mukwege s staff at panzi hospital thousands of women have been able to rebuild their lives some even going on to become nurses doctors and lawyers the goal is to transform their pain into power dr mukwege said we can change hate by love
