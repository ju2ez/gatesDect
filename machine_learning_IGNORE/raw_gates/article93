it should go without saying people are complicated yet i m surprised by the number of biographies i read that paint their subjects in black and white terms a classic example is former u s president richard nixon who is too often portrayed as little more than a crook and a war monger so it was refreshing to see a more balanced account in link by author and journalist evan thomas i wouldn t call it a sympathetic portrait in many ways nixon was a deeply unsympathetic person but it is an empathetic one rather than just focusing on nixon s presidency thomas takes a cradle to the grave approach you follow along as nixon goes from being a lawyer to u s congressman to senator to vice president by the age of he loses a presidential campaign in vows to leave politics forever after a failed bid for california governor gets back into politics and wins the presidency six years later is re elected by a then record landslide and is forced to resign in and even then his story isn t over along the way thomas gives you smart insights into nixon s character you learn about his hard scrabble upbringing and how the social slights he experienced as a child put a chip on his shoulder that would last the rest of his life he suspected that many of washington d c s elites looked down on him and he was right he railed against ivy leaguers insisting that they would never serve in his white house and then proceeded to fill his team with harvard and yale graduates he was socially awkward painfully so but he took on the most public career imaginable thomas doesn t ignore nixon s worst decisions including the secret bombing of cambodia during the vietnam war his support for a military coup in chile and his complicity in covering up the watergate burglary nor does he look past nixon s worst personal qualities like his petty vindictiveness racist outbursts and willingness to ignore the law when it suited him i was a little surprised to learn what a bad manager nixon was although it doesn t compare to his other failings nixon s management style offers some good reminders of how not to run a team he avoided conflict at all costs his staff frequently left meetings with diametrically opposed views on what he had just asked them to do or he would be crystal clear about what he wanted while actually expecting his staff to ignore his demands his team wisely blew off his repeated orders to break into the brookings institution a washington think tank and steal a document that might be damaging to him but the book doesn t get overwhelmed by nixon s dark side thomas gives you a sense of the man s positive qualities he could be tender and even sentimental towards his family and he believed that government really could help people improve their lives the book spends ample time on the positive things nixon accomplished like d tente with china and the soviet union and a domestic agenda that included creating the environmental protection agency and proposing major health care reforms as thomas concludes in the book s final passage nixon was no saint but the fears and insecurities that led him into sinfulness also gave him the drive to push past self doubt to pretend to be cheerful to dare to be brave to see often though sadly not always the light in the dark all in all link is a balanced book that doesn t try to convince you that nixon was all good or all bad it s a worthwhile read for anyone who is interested in this brilliant conflicted and complicated man
