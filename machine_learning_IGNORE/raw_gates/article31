last year there was only one book on my link that you could reasonably call a beach read this year i tried to pick a few more things that are on the lighter side each of these books made me think or laugh or in some cases do both i hope you find something to your liking here and if it s not summer where you live this list will still be here six months from now link link the book based on brosh s link consists of brief vignettes and comic drawings about her young life the adventures she recounts are mostly inside her head where we hear and see the kind of inner thoughts most of us are too timid to let out in public you will rip through it in three hours tops but you ll wish it went on longer because it s funny and smart as hell i must have interrupted melinda a dozen times to read to her passages that made me laugh out loud link link dawkins an evolutionary biologist at oxford has a gift for making science enjoyable this book is as accessible as the tv series link is for younger audiences and as relevant for older audiences it s an engaging well illustrated science textbook offering compelling answers to big questions like how did the universe form and what causes earthquakes it s also a plea for readers of all ages to approach mysteries with rigor and curiosity dawkins s antagonistic and to me overzealous view of religion has earned him a lot of angry critics but i consider him to be one of the great scientific writer explainers of all time link link the subtitle of the book is serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions and that s exactly what it is people write munroe with questions that range over all fields of science physics chemistry biology questions like from what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground the answer it turns out is high enough that it would disintegrate before it hit the ground munroe s explanations are funny but the science underpinning his answers is very accurate it s an entertaining read and you ll also learn a bit about things like ballistics dna the oceans the atmosphere and lightning along the way link a collection of posts from munroe s blog link which is made up of cartoons he draws making fun of things mostly scientists and computers but lots of other things too there s link about scientists holding a press conference to reveal their discovery that life is arsenic based they research press conferences and find out that sometimes it s good to serve food that s related to the subject of the conference the last panel is all the reporters dead on the floor because they ate arsenic it s that kind of humor which not everybody loves but i do link link when i stumbled across this book on the internet i thought it might be a worthwhile read i had no idea what a pleasure reading it would be biss an essayist and university lecturer examines what lies behind people s fears of vaccinating their children like many of us she concludes that vaccines are safe effective and almost miraculous tools for protecting children against needless suffering but she is not out to demonize anyone who holds opposing views this is a thoughtful and beautifully written book about a very important topic link i picked up this short easy to read book after seeing it on a link list of link i enjoyed it so much that it was one of a handful of link to everyone at ted this year it was first published in but aside from a few anachronistic examples it has been a long time since bread cost cents a loaf in the united states it doesn t feel dated one chapter shows you how visuals can be used to exaggerate trends and give distorted comparisons a timely reminder given how often infographics show up in your facebook and twitter feeds these days a useful introduction to the use of statistics and a helpful refresher for anyone who is already well versed in it link link the richer the world gets the more meat it eats and the more meat it eats the bigger the threat to the planet how do we square this circle vaclav smil takes his usual clear eyed view of the whole landscape from meat s role in human evolution to hard questions about animal cruelty while it would be great if people wanted to eat less meat i don t think we can expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions i m betting on innovation including higher agricultural productivity and the development of meat substitutes to help the world meet its need for meat a timely book though probably the least beach friendly one on this list
