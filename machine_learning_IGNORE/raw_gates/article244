one of my link of college is attending classes i hadn t even signed up for and link attending the ones i had so when i was asked if i wanted to sit in on an anthropology course during my recent visit to university of central florida how could i refuse i took a seat in the back of dr beatriz reyes foster s anthropology course language and culture and was immediately swept up in a lively discussion about french philosopher michel foucault s social theory of panopticism it s always thrilling to be back in a classroom and it makes me wish i could be a college student all over again if that wish were ever to come true the college experience would look very different and better at an innovative institution like ucf i m not talking about changes like amazing science labs better dorm food or skateboard racks for students who cruise to classes what s most impressive about ucf is how it s found a way to better serve its growing population of students without compromising on quality or cost historically that s been an impossible feat conventional wisdom in higher education dictates that bigger is not better if an institution wants to boost academic achievement it needs to be more selective and admit fewer students likewise institutions that accept more students expect to experience an inevitable decline in graduation rates and academic achievement ucf is challenging this storyline by proving that a university can have it all a large diverse student population high standards and affordable tuition since ucf has managed to triple the size of its student body to students while at the same time reducing costs boosting its graduation rate and expanding access for low income and first generation students at a time of spiraling higher education costs ucf is one of the most affordable public four year institutions in the country at per year for in state residents the national average for in state tuition at public universities is a key reason for ucf s success is its focus on digital learning which has allowed the university to meet the needs of its expanding student population and keep tuition costs low about percent of ucf students take at least one online course compared with the national average of about percent online learning is popular at ucf just as it is on link link because it offers students more flexibility versus traditional face to face classes with more and more college students working full time and having families online courses give students a way to balance their studies with work and life demands from the university s perspective online courses allow the institution to increase the size of its student population without the expense of constructing more classrooms because of the widespread popularity of digital learning ucf can serve its students on a campus designed for just students saving the university million in capital costs for buildings that would be needed to support those additional students what sets ucf apart from other institutions however is how it s invested in online learning making it a central part of academic life ucf s center for distributed learning has a person team that provides compulsory training for faculty on how to design and teach online courses after completing the training faculty team up with the center s instructional designers to convert their face to face courses into effective online learning experiences the online learning tools the university has developed have helped make teaching and learning smarter one of ucf s most successful approaches for example allows faculty to combine the best of traditional learning with online classes these mixed mode classes are some of the most popular classes on campus among students and faculty dr reyes foster s anthropology course for example meets three times per week twice in a traditional face to face class setting like the one i attended and once online some students learn better in online settings some students learn better in face to face settings and having more options available to them really gives them the best opportunity to do well in college dr reyes foster said a growing body of evidence suggests that students who take mixed mode classes perform better than those learning in face to face settings and are less likely to drop the courses ucf students link while my visit to ucf left me a little nostalgic about my college years i left even more excited about what the innovations in digital learning could mean for today s college students and our country as higher education costs rise the education gap is growing between those from low income backgrounds and the rest of the population this trend means that the poorest americans won t experience the economic benefits of a college degree it also leaves our country with fewer college graduates at a time when our economy needs more college educated workers than ever before solving this challenge will require our higher education institutions to expand access to students of all economic backgrounds and provide them a high quality affordable education in other words our colleges and universities need to be bigger and better ucf has been a pioneer in showing how that can be done i hope other colleges and universities will learn from its success
