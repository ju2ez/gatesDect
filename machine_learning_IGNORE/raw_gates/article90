i turned at the end of october like a lot of people who reach that milestone i got to thinking about the r sum virtues the traits that drive external success and the eulogy virtues the qualities that lead to deeper meaning and finding the right balance between the two my birthday was not the only reason i started thinking about these questions i was also prompted by reading link the latest book by link columnist david brooks brooks sums up his aspiration for the book this way i m hoping you and i will both emerge from the next nine chapters slightly different and slightly better it certainly was a stimulating read and it got me thinking about my own motivations and limitations in new ways the central metaphor of the book comes from the book of genesis borrowing from a rabbi named joseph soleveitchik brooks points out that genesis contains two opposing depictions of adam which represent two different sides of human nature adam i is the career oriented ambitious side of our nature brooks writes he wants to have high status and win victories adam ii in contrast is more internally focused adam ii wants to have a serene inner character a quiet but solid sense of right and wrong not only to do good but to be good brooks fleshes out the adam i adam ii metaphor by offering profiles of a broad set of historical figures not all of them are paragons of virtue but they are paragons of character many of the profiles gave me good food for thought for example i liked the profile of general george marshall who is probably better known today for his visionary plan to rebuild europe after world war ii than for leading the u s army through that war brooks shows that marshall was a man whose r sum accomplishments were built on a eulogy virtue self mastery more commonly known as self restraint or self discipline the ultimate example of marshall s self mastery came in the middle of the war when president franklin roosevelt had to pick a commander of the allied invasion of france brooks writes that marshall secretly craved the assignment and yet he refused to be a self promoter he didn t even request the job when fdr asked him point blank if he wanted it fdr wound up giving the assignment to dwight eisenhower who rode his d day glory all the way to the white house it s hard to imagine a lot of people taking marshall s approach today whether they re in the military politics or business my least favorite profile was of augustine a theologian born in the link century ad one of my friends found this profile to be a compelling one but i didn t buy it although more than a hundred of augustine s books and essays have survived to this day i question how much we can really know about someone who lived that long ago after finishing his chronicles of character brooks uses his final chapter to warn that american society has drifted out of balance he s not trying to scold us into renouncing our worldly ways and becoming modern day augustines and he certainly doesn t believe that our adam i side is evil far from it he s a free market republican who knows our adam i traits are essential for driving the creativity innovation risk taking and job creation that have made america great but he argues that many forces in our economic and cultural life including our intensely competitive meritocracy and social media platforms that nudge us all to be self promoters have made it harder to hear the voice of adam ii brooks believes that this balance shift takes a psychic toll the central fallacy of modern life is the belief that accomplishments of the adam i realm can produce deep satisfaction he writes adam i s desires are infinite and always leap out ahead of whatever has just been achieved only adam ii can experience deep satisfaction i like the way brooks fleshes out the adam i and adam ii sides of human nature but it s not always clear where one starts and the other stops for example you could argue that my work with microsoft was a classic case of adam i r sum building but i found deep satisfaction in that work not because i achieved material success beyond my wildest expectations but because i got to help build a great team and be part of a new industry that unleashed the potential of people all around the world on the other hand some might see my foundation work as based on eulogy virtues but i would be lying if i said that i don t also get a small boost of adam i type satisfaction when that work goes well even if the distinction between r sum and eulogy adam i and adam ii isn t always crystal clear i agree with brooks that it s useful to think about how to get the balance right in a chapter entitled the summoned self he suggests that the voice of adam ii gets louder when we ask what are my circumstances calling me to do he quotes an even more powerful version of this question from the novelist frederick buechner at what points do my talents and deep gladness meet the world s deep need i like that question a lot it s the kind of question we can ask any day not just on those milestone birthdays it can remind us to pay attention to our neighbors around the world it can also help us hear the voice of adam ii
