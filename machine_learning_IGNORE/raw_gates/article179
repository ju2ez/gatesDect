a couple weekends ago i joined warren buffett and others in omaha for woodstock for capitalists a k a the annual meeting of berkshire hathaway as a shareholder and member of the board i ve been going for years and it s always a blast this time we had our usual fun including a ping pong match where warren hit an impressive forehand winner against a former u s national champion but the gathering had an extra resonance because we had something special to celebrate years of warren s leadership at the company a lot has been written about warren in the half century since he took the reins at berkshire but i think the most interesting and insightful stuff is what warren writes himself every year before the annual meeting he puts together a letter to berkshire s shareholders in which he talks very honestly about what s going well and what isn t he also reflects on investing and the economy more broadly if you want to be as smart about business as warren is and who doesn t you can t beat those letters in link warren takes a special look at the company s past present and future i cannot recommend it highly enough it is the best and most important thing he has ever written warren s partner charlie munger link and it is also excellent warren and i took a break from the weekend s events to spend a few minutes talking about his rules for smart investing how he learned to explain complicated financial dealings so clearly and how he got me into bridge and golf and here is a short link featuring some of my favorite photos of warren from over the years warren isn t just a great friend he is also an amazing mentor i have been learning from him since the day we met in we discuss business economics politics world events and of course philanthropy as a trustee of our foundation he is a fantastic thought partner for melinda and me two years ago i wrote about link it boils down to this he is always encouraging melinda and me to tackle tough problems and have the courage to make mistakes luckily for berkshire s shareholders and for everyone involved with the dozens of businesses in the berkshire family warren follows this wisdom himself for the better part of years he has been thinking big and we are all better off for it
