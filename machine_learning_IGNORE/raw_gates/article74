i recommend a lot of nonfiction books on gates notes and every once in a while i review a novel but i don t think i ve ever written about a book of link before that s almost what maylis de kerangal s link is though it s poetry disguised as a novel the story itself is simple three french year olds go surfing in the middle of the night and as they re driving back from the beach just before sunrise they get in a car accident two of them survive but one of them simon dies and his parents have to decide whether to donate his heart or not they decide to do it and doctors transplant the heart and the book is over that s it the car crash happens in the first pages so the rest of the book is a meditation on life death and as the title suggests the heart there aren t even that many characters you meet simon s father and mother the doctor on duty at the hospital when simon gets there the nurse assisting him the head of the organ donation organization the woman who gets the heart in the end and a few other people but just describing the plot is like saying during a heart transplant doctors put one person s heart into another person s body and leaving it at that it s not the plot that makes link such a wonderful book first of all there s the language it makes me think of vladimir nabokov more than anybody else the sentences are rich and full and they go on and on which is the exact opposite of how i write there are sentences that last entire paragraphs at times i found myself reading more slowly than usual simply because the way she describes things is so beautiful at one point she describes a character s words as reddening rocks from a still burning fire the word choices are very specific i went to the dictionary a dozen times to look up words i didn t know but link turned out to be exactly what the passage needed the book connects you deeply with people who are only in the story for a few minutes you get really detailed backstories about all the characters kerangal goes on for pages about the girlfriend of the surgeon who does the transplant for example even though you never meet that character in the end the effect is to remind you that all the people you meet in the novel and all the people you meet every day even if it s just for a few seconds have lives as full as yours and then there are the themes kerangal is dealing with grief most of all and how it feels to have to change your life suddenly because somebody who was in it isn t in it anymore when i travel for the foundation i meet parents whose children have died and children whose parents have died and i get sad every time this book forced me to feel the depth of that grief and it was an experience i appreciated i told a friend the other day that she especially would like link just like me she mostly reads nonfiction and this book is a good counterweight when melinda recommended the book to me she said it s different from most of the books you read and that s true but part of the reason for that is that it s different from most books
