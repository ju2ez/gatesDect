when i was a student i was lucky to have some inspiring teachers including a wonderful librarian when i was in the fourth grade and a chemistry teacher in high school who challenged me and brought out my best they helped make me the person i am today i recently met a remarkable teacher who is doing the same thing for kids who face obstacles i never could have imagined when i was in school her name is mandy manning and she teaches english and math in spokane washington to immigrant and refugee teenagers who have just arrived in the united states they come from all over the world syria guatemala afghanistan myanmar sudan mexico tanzania even link they show up at school speaking little or no english some have fallen far behind in other subjects after months or years of living in refugee camps mandy is the first teacher they encounter in this country in recognition of her work mandy was named washington state s teacher of the year she also had the big honor of being named link for her efforts to help her students process trauma celebrate their home countries and culture and learn about their new community like other recent washington teachers of the year see link link link link link link and link link she was nice enough to visit my office so i could learn more about her and her students mandy teaches at ferris high school s newcomer center which was created in specifically to help immigrant and refugee students make the transition to living in the u s i ve been going to spokane for years to visit relatives there so i know a bit about the city but i was surprised to learn how diverse the student population is mandy told me different languages are spoken in the district it s not unusual for her to have a class with students who speak eight different languages a lot of the kids have come through trauma to get to the united states mandy told me they ve faced war extreme poverty religious and political persecution the loss of family members and it s not automatically the land of milk and honey when you get here they have days where they re struggling with culture shock or post traumatic stress now it s gotten a little bit worse because people feel more empowered to say really hateful things even so mandy says her students are innately hopeful because they came out alive the kids are so excited to be in school she said it s a moment in their day where they know what is expected they re generally at the newcomer center for one semester before transitioning to ferris or one of spokane s other high schools they spend five periods a day with mandy learning english and math and one period with another teacher working on basic computer skills like how to use software and navigate a website they interact as much as possible with their peers at ferris high going to pep rallies and sporting events and staffing the student store it s a great way to make friends practice their english and get to know their new community mandy shared some of her students unforgettable stories she told me about a year old sudanese girl who arrived at the newcomer center in after spending much of her life in a refugee camp in kenya the girl had a fourth grade education and spoke very little english when she arrived in spokane but through a ton of her own hard work and support from her teachers she graduated from high school in four years today she s enrolled at a university here in washington state where she s studying to be an elementary school teacher i hadn t met many national teachers of the year before so i asked mandy what that s been like she s not in the classroom this year instead she s visiting schools and talking with educators across the country she compared it to the time she served in the peace corps in armenia it s mostly about cultural exchange she said i bring back what i learn and they hopefully have learned a little from me in addition to listening and learning mandy is using her platform to champion ideas about education that she has developed in her year career she s a big advocate for making sure kids see how their classes are relevant to their lives she said when that happens when you re really engaged by your studies you can be a time traveler seeing yourself in the future going to a university she is also calling attention to the disparities between high and low income schools and she argues persuasively that teachers need more of a voice in setting education policies she wrote an excellent link link link on that point hearing mandy talk about her students reminded me of one of the biggest strengths of america s public schools they are intended to help every child succeed the fact that some places fall short of that ideal should not obscure the successes that are happening in spokane and other cities across the country and behind every one of those successes are super talented hard working teachers like mandy manning
