sometimes people have suggested that i ve got a photographic memory particularly when i m talking about topics that interest me like science and business it s a nice compliment but it s not really true not even close for example my friend mike is so much better than i am at remembering movie facts what actor was in which movie and when it was made i can t do that i do still remember every line of the first complex software program i ever wrote because i spend a lot of time thinking about science and business i have a structure or a context that the facts can fit into like oh this company is like that one but different in this way i think most people have good memory for things in the domains they re really interested in i never thought much about whether i could improve my memory across a wider set of domains but now i think i could after reading link by a young science writer joshua foer it s absolutely phenomenal one of the most interesting link foer got interested in memory as a way to understand how the mind works that took him to the world memory contest where people can do things like memorize the order of a deck of cards in just a few minutes he was fascinated he wondered are some people born with very good memories but it turns out except for people like the main character in rain man and just a very few other people whose brains are wired differently the average human memory is extremely good at tasks that are important to you and extremely poor at things that aren t as important that s why just trying to force a bunch of random facts into your head is hard but you re extremely good at remembering faces or images visual memory being a survival advantage in our evolutionary history it s amazing you can flash thousands of images at people and they can recall seeing them and can notice small changes in them even days later lots of practice in visualizing is key to a strong memory when you re reading a book you don t sit there and say well what does that word mean what does that word mean after many sightings of the words in your vocabulary your recall is immediate and very very good domain expertise works the same way if you play bridge for years you have seen many bridge hands and you recognize patterns in them which can give you a phenomenal ability to remember a new bridge hand i ll admit to being a long way off from this kind of bridge recall foer discovered that the people who win memory contests use certain techniques for visualizing things techniques mostly developed in ancient greece they talk about what they do as building a memory palace often literally visualizing a house with many rooms and different people and things in each room representing what they are trying to remember garlic on the driveway cottage cheese at the doorstep things like that the idea comes from an link who remembered the names of everyone who was killed when a temple collapsed during a banquet he had a visual memory of where everyone was seated foer wasn t sure these techniques really worked so he spent a year practicing them every day after just a year he entered and won the u s memory championship he actually broke the u s speed record for memorizing a deck of cards he did it by learning to associate each card with a person action or place then remembering an image like moonwalking with einstein helped him to recall three cards in the right order and he only needed to remember such images to memorize the whole deck when i first heard of someone memorizing a deck of cards i thought i couldn t do that now i think hey i could do it although i haven t started to try yet like most people i m fascinated by how the mind works and memory is a big element of that part of the beauty of this book is that it makes clear how memory and understanding are not two different things building up the ability to reason and the ability to retain information go hand in hand don t believe anybody who tells you it s easy though most of us will have to practice for months and months and months you have to be very serious about it the book reminds us that we all start off with pretty much the same tools for the most part and we can be intentional about strengthening them or not
