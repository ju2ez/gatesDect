a few years ago i met with a group of doctors and scientists in tanzania to discuss the challenge of getting more people on hiv treatment huge progress has been made in the fight against hiv through increased access to lifesaving aids drugs for millions of people around the world and yet only half of the million people living with hiv are receiving treatment as we talked about possible solutions to this problem tom ellman of doctors without borders stepped forward to share what his organization had learned about a new approach to delivering hiv treatment he spoke briefly just minutes but as soon as he had finished i thought link the innovation tom described wasn t a new technology it was a way of simplifying hiv treatment to make it more efficient and responsive to the needs of the patients and as i note below the groups highlighted in this video are just one example of the approach tom told me about last week i asked tom to share link in new york city at link an event to celebrate global health and development successes and focus on what challenges remain including in the fight against hiv tom told the audience about mozambique where doctors without borders has been working in support of the government on hiv since when hiv treatment was first rolled out the government followed a traditional approach doctors working in centralized clinics controlled the care and treatment for hiv patients in a country where one in adults was living with hiv clinic staff were so overburdened that they often could spend just a few minutes with each patient patients regularly traveled hours to reach clinics and waited in long lines to receive care while the program was successful in putting thousands of patients on treatment for the first time it wasn t serving the needs of the patients as well as it could not surprisingly many patients about percent dropped off treatment in small groups of hiv patients from villages around tete mozambique decided to challenge this approach instead of walking for hours every month to pick up their antiretroviral arv medication they would send one of their group to pick up drugs for all the other group members on a rotating basis and that s how a new model of care known as the community antiretroviral therapy art groups cags got started reduced wait times and less frequent visits to the clinic made getting hiv treatment easier and more patients stayed on treatment and stayed healthier it also eased the burden on the country s overloaded health care system giving staff more time to focus on patients who needed the most help with clear evidence that these new models of care were making a difference doctors without borders worked with mozambique s ministry of health to expand these groups across the country the community art groups are just one example of what s known as differentiated models of care which are now being applied in link link in other countries communities operate their own link to distribute hiv medication or have adapted approaches to meet the specific needs of the patients and their communities the essence of these models is very simple you listen to patients you trust them and adapt your services to their needs you simplify things you de medicalize things tom says it s pretty striking to hear a doctor talk about reducing the role of doctors in treatment but the results speak for themselves this approach also became a real catalyst for our foundation although we don t fund doctors without borders it inspired us to take a bigger role in spreading differentiated models to other countries what impresses me about tom is that he is always looking to build on the progress that s been made if the goal is to provide treatment to everyone who needs it the world needs to go further we need to adapt models of care for the hundreds of millions left behind in conflict zones in fragile states for migrants and refugees he said next doctors without borders is eager to see how these new models of patient centered care could be used to improve treatment for other diseases like tuberculosis or to expand access to vulnerable and marginalized groups including sex workers migrants and those caught in conflict areas these models could also be adapted to family planning or non communicable diseases tom s vision is to develop health care systems based on trust and equal partnership between health professionals and communities by empowering communities he imagines a world where leaving no one behind is not just a slogan thanks to the work of tom his colleagues and the patients they re partnering with it is on the way to becoming a reality
