i spend my days asking why link being curious and trying to explain the world around us is part of what makes life interesting it s also good for the world scientific discoveries happen because someone insisted on solving some mystery and it s human nature as anyone who s fielded an endless series of questions from an inquisitive year old can tell you but as kate bowler shows in her wonderful new memoir link some why questions can t be answered satisfactorily with facts bowler was years old married to her high school sweetheart and raising their young son when she was diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer when she got sick she didn t want to know what was making her body s cells mutate and multiply out of control she had deeper questions link link link the book is about her search for answers that align with her deeply held religious beliefs a professor at duke divinity school in north carolina she grew up in a family of mennonites and wrote a history of the prosperity gospel the idea popular among some christians that god rewards the faithful with health and wealth before she got sick bowler didn t subscribe to the prosperity gospel but she didn t exactly reject it either i had my own prosperity gospel a flowering weed grown in with all the rest she writes i believed god would make a way then came her diagnosis i don t believe that anymore given the topic i wasn t surprised to find that bowler s book is heartbreaking at times but i didn t expect it to be funny too sometimes it s both in the same passage in one scene bowler learns there s a percent chance that her cancer might be susceptible to an experimental treatment a few weeks later her doctor s office calls with good news she s among the percent i start to yell link she turns to her husband i might have a chance i manage to say between sobs he hugs me tightly resting his chin on my head and then he releases me to let me sing link and do a lot of punching the air because it is in my nature to do so the central questions in this book really resonated with me on one hand it s nihilistic to think that every outcome is simply random i have to believe that the world is better when we act morally and that people who do good things deserve a somewhat better fate on average than those who don t but if you take it to extremes that cause and effect view can be hurtful bowler recounts some of the unintentionally painful things that well meaning people told her like this is a test and it will make you stronger i have also seen how this line of thinking affected members of my own extended family all four of my grandparents were deeply devout members of a christian sect who believed that if you got sick it must be because you did something to deserve it when one of my grandfathers became seriously ill he struggled to figure out what he might have done wrong he couldn t think of anything so he blamed his wife he died thinking she had caused his illness by committing some unknown sin bowler answers the why question in a compelling way by refusing to accept the premise as the title suggests she rejects the idea that we need a reason for everything that happens but she also rejects the nihilist alternative as she said in link if i could pick one thing it would be that everyone simmers down on the explanations for other people s suffering and just steps in with love she even includes an appendix with six ways you can support a friend or loved one who s sick it s worth dog earing for future reference link belongs on the shelf alongside other terrific books about this difficult subject like link link and atul gawande s link bowler s writing is direct and unsentimental she s not saying her life is unfair or that she deserved better she s just telling you what happened i won t spoil the ending except to say that bowler has too much integrity as a writer to offer pat answers or magic solutions when i was done with the book i went online to see how she was doing i was happy to find that she was still link about faith morality and mortality it s inspiring to see this thoughtful woman face such weighty topics with honesty and humor
