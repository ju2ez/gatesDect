i read a lot about teddy roosevelt last year around the time melinda and i took our kids to the panama canal he was instrumental in getting the canal built and i d assumed it was the highlight of his career so it s a testament to the breadth and depth of roosevelt s accomplishments that the canal warrants only a handful of mentions in this biography there s just too much other fascinating material competing for space from roosevelt s relationship with the press and his friendship with william howard taft who was brilliant in his own right to his efforts to fight corruption and reform the political system i m especially interested in the central question that doris kearns goodwin raises in link how does social change happen can it be driven by a single inspirational leader or do other factors have to lay the groundwork first sometimes a single leader can make a big difference in the field of global health link almost single handedly created a global constituency for children sparking a movement to double vaccination rates and save millions of lives but roosevelt s case was different although he tried to push through a number of political reforms earlier in his career he wasn t really successful until journalists at link and other publications had rallied public support for change i loved doris kearns goodwin s link about president lincoln and highly recommend this one too
