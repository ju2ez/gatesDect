health workers have an unusual tool for fighting disease that turns our old thinking about treatment on its head i saw it at work recently in a remote hilltop village in tanzania where i joined a group of health workers going from house to house to distribute medicine to wipe out lymphatic filariasis one of the world s most painful and debilitating diseases at each home one health worker told the family about the swollen limbs disfigurements and other symptoms of the parasitic disease another carried a tall stick to measure the height of each family member to determine the correct dosage then if they were willing to be treated the parents and children took their pills and washed them down with a cup of water before our team moved on to the next house what was surprising about this effort is that none of the people who took the medicine were sick the village i visited was participating in what s known as a mass drug administration campaign which seeks to treat everyone against a disease even if they are not actually infected or show any symptoms typically of course the sick are the ones who get treated not the people who are healthy but when it comes to combating some diseases like lymphatic filariasis it s critical for health workers to try to treat the entire at risk population to break the cycle of transmission if not the disease could continue to be spread by those who are not aware they are infected ten countries have successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis in this way including link which this year became the first country in sub saharan africa to wipe out the disease still more than million people in countries worldwide remain threatened by lymphatic filariasis mass drug administration is not only effective against lymphatic filariasis but also other link including schistosomiasis onchocerciasis trachoma and soil transmitted helminths these diseases go by names that are largely unknown and link but it should be easy to understand why we should all care about them they afflict people living in the poorest countries and cause untold suffering lymphatic filariasis is one of the worst of these diseases it s caused by a parasite that s spread by mosquitoes and in the severest cases people may develop swollen limbs a thickening of the skin known as elephantiasis or other severe disfigurements beyond the pain and disabilities they experience people affected by the disease are often ostracized by their communities and are unable to work sinking them deeper into poverty to combat lymphatic filariasis health officials could test everyone and then treat only those people who are infected but testing the population for these diseases would be expensive and slow the medicines used for treatment ivermectin and albendazole however are inexpensive and have no side effects making mass treatment a more effective approach to protect people from the disease and thanks to the link billions of doses of these and other medicines combating neglected tropical diseases are being donated for free like many countries running mass drug administration programs tanzania s biggest challenge is treating enough of its population at risk of the disease to break the cycle of transmission health workers must treat at least percent of the population every year for to years as you might imagine meeting this target year after year is not easy health officials must have strong public awareness campaigns thousands of trained health workers a well organized supply chain to distribute medicines to the remotest corners of the country and regular disease surveying to track their progress at the same time the program provides treatment and care for people who are suffering from the debilitating symptoms of the diseases walking from door to door in the village with the health workers i was struck that perhaps the most important element of the program is trust taking the medicine is strictly voluntary making it important that the health workers distributing it earn the confidence of the community the health workers i met certainly had they were knowledgeable passionate about their work and clearly cared about the community they were serving at each home they took the time to explain the goal of the program and address any of the villagers questions or concerns thanks to their hard work the latest survey of lymphatic filariasis in their district showed that the cycle of transmission had been broken for the first time the village was not at risk of the disease by tanzania hopes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis entirely within its borders based on what i saw in this village i m optimistic they will
