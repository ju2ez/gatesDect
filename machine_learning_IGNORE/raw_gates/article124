link link guns germs and steellink the world until yesterdaylink link link link link link link when i proposed that to my editor my editor said jared people don t want a little autobiographical book from you they want a big book summarizing everything about the world for thousands of years so my observations became the frosting on the cake the cake itself is scholarly studies by people who ve lived with about traditional societies around the world and their observations on various aspects of those societies link the opposite view idealizes traditional people as tree hugging peaceful environmentalists who don t have war and are not subject to all the evil things that began with our state governments both of those extremes of course are unrealistic because people are people in some cases what goes on in traditional society is pretty terrible and our reaction is thank god we re through with that such as uninterrupted tribal warfare in other cases what goes on in traditional societies most of us would admire and many of us can adopt it ourselves individually such as the way they bring up children link the new guineans had been fighting with each other until a few years before that so the australians would come in they d make examples of new guineans who did fight by arresting them the australian patrol eventually marched away leaving this one patrol officer and four policemen and their five guns it s perfectly obvious that if those new guineans had wanted to resume fighting it would have been the simplest thing in the world to kill or ambush the patrol officer and the four policemen it s not the mighty military power of those five guns that are keeping the people from fighting the reason is that in traditional new guinea there was not a higher authority that could order an end to warfare and so new guineans were caught up in these almost endless cycles of revenge and counter revenge new guineans knew better than i or any of my readers what they suffered from warfare i should add that it s not the case that all traditional societies are universally violent it appears that hunter gatherers living in low population density are less violent than settled sedentary farming societies because the farming societies can have borders that they can police it s also the case that societies that don t have anything valuable worth defending are less likely to fight link so we ve evolved under traditional conditions for a very long time and it s only within the last years that the stuff that we take for granted like state governments has arrived and that hasn t given much time for genetic change now i have to add there has been some genetic change we ve gotten genetic change in some populations that allows us to drink milk as adults whereas there wasn t any human on the face of the earth who drank milk as an adult before probably about years ago link and so i worry that taking a shower is the most dangerous thing i ll do today i also stood on a stepladder the second most dangerous thing that i ll do today
