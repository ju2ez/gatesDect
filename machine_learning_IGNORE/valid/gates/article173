link in the past few years it has become easy to find many of the important statistics on global development with a quick online search and since it is now so easy to find the information you need many argue that it doesn t make sense to actually remember these statistics link they say i disagree with this yes for some details it makes sense to just search for them when you need them but for the large global developments it is important to know some basic statistics that describe living conditions currently and the direction of change that we have seen over the past few decades knowing the facts on global changes gives you the context for the daily news and allows you to make sense of new information that you learn and it must be the basis for political debate so that we can discuss what we should and shouldn t do as a society and so i compiled a short list of three facts about global living conditions that i want to remember each of them describes the current situation and the direction of change link imagine how awful it must be to see your child die then consider that every minute this happens to about parents this is the number of children younger than five years of age who die on average every single minute eleven deaths every minute for hours add up to deaths per day or million deaths per year do we just have to accept that is that just how the world is clearly no we are very much able to drive positive change look at the chart below the same un data that shows us that million are dying today also shows us that in the s and s the world saw around million children dying every year one key reason why we struggle to see progress in the world today is that we do not know how very bad the past was both are true at the same time the world is much better than in the past and it is still awful to bring this to mind i need to know both statistics when someone says we can sit back and relax because the world is in a much better place i point out that children are still dying every minute we cannot accept the world as it is today and when i feel hopeless in the face of this tragedy i remember that we reduced annual child deaths from million to million in the last fifty years so i am remembering the current extent of child mortality and the direction of change that we have seen the number of child deaths is falling there were times as many child deaths years ago but child deaths are still extremely common children are dying every minute link the chart below shows the key statistic to understand about world population growth the link the average number of children per woman in the world when the fertility rate is close to children per woman so that every couple is on average replaced by about two children population growth is slow but until the late s each woman had on average more than children and at such high fertility rates population growth is fast at that time the world population increased link every year the availability of contraceptives allows parents to have only as many children as they want and that number changes as people s income goes up from link we know that women decide to have fewer children as they get access to better education and better opportunities in the job market we also know that when child mortality falls so that families do not need to fear that their children will die they consequently decide to have fewer children in the first place improvements in conditions for women and the health of children have driven a rapid reduction in fertility rates across the world in fact the global fertility rate has halved in the last years from more than children per woman to fewer than children the world population growth rate has also halved in the last years and is just above percent the statistic that i remember on population growth is the one that tells me that rapid population growth is coming to an end in this century in the last years the global fertility rate has fallen from children per woman to less than children per woman in fifty years the fertility rate has halved link living in poverty means that many of the most essential things in life are out of reach people in poverty tend to lack decent shelter and basic healthcare and they often struggle to afford adequate food supplies people are considered to live in extreme poverty if they have to get by on less than international dollars per day which is a currency that corrects for price differences between countries and inflation in this definition of poverty the term link poverty is clearly appropriate this is a very low poverty line when you ask people whether the world is making progress against extreme poverty the majority of us link that the number of people in extreme poverty in the world is rising the opposite is true both the number and the share of people in extreme poverty is falling in billion people were living on less than international per day more than every third person in the world twenty five years later the number of people living in extreme poverty has more than halved to million every tenth person this is a very large transformation it means that on average every day for the past years fewer people were living in extreme poverty than the day before on every day in the last years there could have been a newspaper headline reading the number of people in extreme poverty fell by since yesterday this is the statistic i remember today every th person is living in extreme poverty million people an unacceptably large number of people but we should also know that the trend is moving in the right direction the number of people in extreme poverty is falling it is possible to end extreme poverty remembering these facts about the world brings to mind why i think it is important to get engaged in global development the statistics on the current state of the world make clear that we cannot be complacent about the world as it is today especially because progress is uneven and in sub saharan africa progress has been slower but is link the statistics on global change over time tell us that it is possible to work for a better world the number of child deaths is dropping the challenges of rapid population growth will not continue indefinitely and the number of people in extreme poverty is falling let s continue in this direction our past successes should encourage us to work for more progress
