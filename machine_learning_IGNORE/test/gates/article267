i have learned a lot about energy storage by investing in companies that are making batteries better and more affordable there is some fantastic research going on and some fantastic companies being built but we need even more innovation why because although solar and wind power are great sources of low carbon energy they also have their downsides one is that they re not constant sources with solar it s not just that the sun goes away at night cloudy days also make it hard for some places to use solar year round according to link from noaa my hometown of seattle gets less sun than all but cities in the united states when you hear about this problem with wind and solar it is tempting to ask can t we generate extra energy on days when the sun and wind are strong and store it for those days when they re not here s the problem storing energy turns out to be surprisingly hard and expensive as i wrote in this year s link if you wanted to store enough electricity to run everything in your house for a week you would need a huge battery and it would triple your electric bill let s break that sentence down link link according to this link in the typical u s household used kilowatt hours a month which works out to roughly kilowatt hours per week per month days per month x days per week the best lithium ion batteries store less than kilowatt hours per kilogram so a lithium ion battery large enough to store kilowatt hours would weigh at least or kg kg is about pounds or more than one ton link this figure is based on the capital cost of a lithium ion battery amortized over the useful life of the battery for example a battery that costs per kilowatt hour of capacity with a life cycle of charges would over its lifetime cost or per kilowatt hour so if a consumer tried to store enough electricity in this lithium ion battery to run her house she would be paying at least per kilowatt hour for the battery according to the link the average price of electricity for consumers in the united states is around per kilowatt hour the european union where prices average cents per kilowatt hour and india where they range from to cents would see similarly dramatic increases this is one of the reasons why we need new inventions that improve our ability to store energy cheaply and efficiently getting them will make it easier for solar and wind to be a big part of our zero carbon future
