in atlanta earlier this year melinda and i met a young woman i ll call sharon that s not her real name sharon works hours a day seven days a week she is a single mom with two sons including a newborn while sharon was in the hospital after the birth of her new son she missed a single rent payment on her apartment she came home to discover that link when we met sharon was still fighting the eviction and getting help from a legal aid group but it was clear she was in crisis it broke our hearts to hear what she and her boys were going through meeting sharon put a face and name on an issue i had been thinking about a lot just a few days before we met i finished reading link by matthew desmond a sociologist at princeton university and a grantee of our foundation i can see why desmond received one of the macarthur foundation s genius grants and won a pulitzer for his book his research shows that experiences like sharon s are not some aberration hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of americans are evicted from their homes every year in milwaukee where desmond did his reporting one in eight renters were forced to move in a two year period as stunning as those numbers are link is primarily about people not data desmond has written a brilliant portrait of americans living in poverty i have no personal experience with the kind of crisis faced by sharon or the people profiled in link so i can only learn about it by hearing their stories this book gave me a better sense of what it is like to be very poor in this country than anything else i have read desmond spent months living in two high poverty neighborhoods in milwaukee one mostly white the other mostly black getting to know the residents and documenting their lives you meet both landlords and renters and he portrays them all without being the least bit judgmental he just helps you understand why they make the choices they make although the specifics of their lives are unlike anything i have experienced desmond makes it easy to empathize with them true to its title much of link is about how hard it is to find and keep a home when you live in deep poverty most experts agree that the ideal is to spend no more than percent of your income on housing according to desmond s research most poor families have to spend over percent on housing and for many it s over percent when you re paying so much to keep a roof over your head there s no room for bad luck a single bad incident can send you reeling one woman in the book arleen gets evicted from her apartment after someone breaks down her front door over a minor dispute involving kids throwing snowballs another time she falls irreparably behind on the rent after helping to pay for the funeral of a close friend for me though link s biggest contribution isn t the focus on housing it s the dramatic illustration of the ways in which issues of poverty are intertwined when someone has to search for a new place to live they miss work which cuts back on their pay and makes them more likely to get fired and all this instability has a terrible impact on children one of arleen s sons attends five different schools in a single year i also got a glimpse of how gut wrenching it must be when someone piles up your belongings on the curb and you don t know where your family is going to sleep that night it s no wonder that people who have been evicted experience significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety as desmond puts it eviction s fallout is severe losing a home sends families to shelters abandoned houses and the street it invites depression and illness compels families to move into degrading housing in dangerous neighborhoods uproots communities and harms children eviction reveals people s vulnerability and desperation as well as their ingenuity and guts melinda and i have been working for some time to learn more about how americans move up the economic ladder what experts call link link helped me understand one piece of that very complex question and itlink made me want to learn more about the systemic problems that make housing unaffordable as well as the various government programs designed to help desmond briefly goes over the history of public housing big government run projects are largely a thing of the past and today most poor people live in private housing but because funding hasn t kept up with the need he writes only about a quarter of families that qualify for help paying their rent actually get any the wait list for a housing voucher is often measured not in months or even years but in decades if you re interested in reading more about how these problems disproportionately affect african americans and in the role that legal segregation has played i strongly recommended reading link by richard rothstein i was stunned by the huge role that federal policy has played in creating segregated housing patterns link raises one big question that it doesn t really answer how can low income neighborhoods have cheap real estate and vacant houses but still lack decent affordable homes as desmond notes the average rent for a two bedroom apartment in milwaukee s highest poverty areas was only less than the citywide median but he doesn t say a lot about what causes this for example how restrictive zoning and strict building codes may drive up the cost of even a modest home to be fair there s a lot that we simply don t know about this question there isn t good data on this subject so desmond has set out to learn more with support from our foundation he is calculating eviction rates for every city in the country he is looking deeper into these market failures to understand why housing prices stay so high even in low income neighborhoods we funded this work long before i read link i am eager to see what desmond s research discovers in the meantime link is well worth reading for anyone who wants to better understand poverty in america it is beautifully written thought provoking and unforgettable
