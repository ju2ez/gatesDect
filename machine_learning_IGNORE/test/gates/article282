it s always stimulating to talk with president clinton and last monday i was lucky enough to join him on stage at the peterson foundation s fiscal summit we did a q a session for nearly an hour on budget and policy questions foreign aid american competitiveness and education and that was just part of the discussion which was hosted by the link show s tamron hall president clinton has been a terrific advocate for africa and has done amazing work in philanthropy through his foundation and the link so it was great to catch up with him we agreed on the need to address both the short term and long term fiscal problems facing the united states particularly with a view toward keeping the country competitive in the global marketplace and the need to invest in basic research and education at the end of the session tamron asked about the possibility of a strong well respected female candidate for president who has extensive international experience and then turned to me and asked me whether melinda was considering a run i m sure she would be flattered but we both love the jobs we have i told tamron i don t think she ll be throwing her hat in the ring
