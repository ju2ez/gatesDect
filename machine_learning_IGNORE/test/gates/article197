when i talk to friends about global health i often run into a strange paradox the idea of saving one person s life is profound and thrilling but i ve found that when you talk about saving millions of lives it sounds almost meaningless the higher the number the harder it is to wrap your head around for example if the world accelerates the fight against hiv aids over the next years we can save million lives how many people is million it is roughly the population of australia or the number of people who live in mumbai if you found out that a plague was going to wipe out the entire population of a city or country tomorrow you would want the world to do everything possible to save their lives although preventing million aids deaths is on a different time scale morally there is no difference it is just as pressing the chart above is drawn from a link link by a group of economists who explored what s possible if the world invests more in global health the aids data for example assume that we expand hiv prevention and treatment the report which our foundation funded confirms what global health advocates have long believed investing in health is an extremely effective way to break the poverty cycle in fact it concludes that with the right investments the world can close the health gap between rich and poor countries that would mean every country in the world will have child mortality rates that are as low as the rate in america or the united kingdom in link is a key year for these issues in september the united nations will come together to adopt goals about what should be done for the poor by it s a follow up to the millennium development goals which did an amazing job of getting the world to focus on how the poor are faring i hope that by bringing both more attention and more funding to these issues we can save millions of lives and make unprecedented progress by if you want to learn more about the u n s goals for and what you can do to help i d encourage you to link link
