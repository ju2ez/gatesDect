i ended by compiling something slightly unusual a list of some of the good news you might have missed i thought it was a pretty good note to end the year on and people seemed to like reading about some of the ways the world is becoming a better place this year i thought i d do it again of course we can t ignore the fact that it s been a turbulent year in the united states and many other countries but it s worth taking a moment to celebrate some of the good news too more children are surviving than ever before we re making progress against some of the world s deadliest diseases these are some of the most fundamental ways to measure the world s progress and by that measure was definitely another good year to me one of the best ways to measure progress is to look at how many children are dying of preventable causes and today more kids are living to see their fifth birthday than ever before this year for at least the link year in a row the child mortality rate has fallen and it s not just moving in the right direction it s falling faster than anyone expected link ran a great article about this in september where it estimated that just since the world has saved million children s lives it s hard to think of a better sign the world is improving the world has done an impressive job of providing treatment to people living with hiv but for years we were falling behind because for all the people who started getting treatment even more would become infected not anymore though new data link show that was the first year when more people started getting treatment than became infected with hiv why does that matter because treating people not only keeps them alive it also dramatically reduces the odds that they will pass the virus on to anyone else as the epidemiologists say we can start to bend the curve of the disease we still have a long way to go before we can declare the end of aids but this is a big milestone when i read an article in the late s that mentioned a diarrheal disease called rotavirus killed hundreds of thousands of kids a year i couldn t believe something i d never even heard of was killing that many children but rotavirus doesn t get much press because it s almost never deadly in rich countries and the world tends to ignore diseases that only affect the world s poorest people in many ways rotavirus was a catalyst for my commitment to global health in fact one of our foundation s first grants supported efforts against rotavirus since then the number of kids dying from this illness has been cut nearly in half thanks to link and today that vaccine is reaching more kids than ever before for example in india where rota kills nearly children a year the government link to deliver the vaccine for free to poor children and manufacturers there are working on a more affordable vaccine that could reach even more children in the coming years the world is way overdue for a better tuberculosis treatment tb is one of the world s leading causes of death and our existing treatments are inadequate especially for link but efforts to improve them have been stalled for decades so it s a big deal that earlier this year scientists link that a new tb treatment regimen has proven effective in early phase research from here the drug regimen goes on to a large clinical trial to confirm the results if this new treatment regimen pans out it could dramatically reduce the time it takes to cure drug resistant tb and save poor countries billions of dollars in health care costs a lot of the media coverage about nigeria this year focused on two things ebola and terrorism both are frightening and they masked the fact that from a global health perspective nigeria actually had a pretty good year although it s one of only three countries that have never been free from polio pakistan and afghanistan are the other two i don t think it will be on that list for long nigeria has reported only six cases of polio this year compared to more than last year what s more the infrastructure nigeria has built to fight polio actually made it easier for them to swiftly contain ebola the fact that nigeria is now link is a great example of how doing the work to fight things like fighting polio also leaves countries better prepared to deal with outbreaks of other diseases one more thing this january melinda and i will publish our annual letter this year we re looking ahead to we ll be writing about a few areas from health to farming and banking where life will really change especially for people in some of the world s poorest places spoiler alert we think there s a lot more progress ahead if you d like to get an e mail notice when the letter is out you can sign up below
