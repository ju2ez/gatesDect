imagine for a moment that you are a woman in rural malawi a landlocked country in southeastern africa and one of the most impoverished countries in the world now imagine you are expecting a child chances are good that you live at least a few hours away from your closest health facility so you may or may not have received any prenatal care or gone to any doctor s appointments during your pregnancy that also means that when you go into labor you might decide that your best option is to give birth at home the same thing your mother did when you were born of course there is a lot that can go wrong when a woman gives birth at home without the help of a doctor or midwife or access to lifesaving drugs and medical equipment so it s very possible that long after your contractions begin you realize that the labor isn t progressing as it should you ve seen this happen to other women before and you know that both you and your baby are at serious risk you may not know the technical term obstructed labor or be familiar with the statistics but you know from your own experience that it s one of the major causes of maternal mortality staying at home is no longer an option so your family finds a bicycle you climb on behind your husband for the long bumpy trip to the health facility when you arrive the midwives can tell immediately that you need a c section but since there is no one qualified to perform one at this rural health center you are referred to another hospital which means another long bike ride and another delay in getting the care you need but the second hospital can t help either their electricity is out a frequent occurrence in malawi and the staff can t perform surgery without lights in the operating room even though they know you re at risk for a deadly uterine rupture they have no choice but to refer you to a third hospital by now every second counts you re exhausted and in so much pain that things around you seem blurry but you know that what happens in the next few hours will mean the difference between life and death for both you and your baby this is a story that repeats itself over and over again and not always with a happy ending one out of every women in malawi dies from complications related to pregnancy or delivery almost everyone i ve met in malawi personally knows a woman whose pregnancy ended in death but the good news is that this story is starting to change malawi has cut its maternal mortality rate in half since and malawians across the country from president peter mutharika to community midwives in the most impoverished villages are committed to getting the number of women who die in labor and delivery even lower in the government began implementing a national safe motherhood initiative aimed at ensuring that all women and their babies are within reach of quality lifesaving care when it matters the most so that no more women or newborns suffer deaths that could have and should have been prevented when i visited malawi in june with our foundation ceo sue desmond hellmann we got to meet some of the men and women who are putting this plan to save women and children into action here are some of their stories
