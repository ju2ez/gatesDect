link so how important do you think confidence is in your business do you think it matters i tell you it matters a lot i happen to witness over the years that confidence is one of the key factors that really determines how you behave what actions you take and what results you get in your business confidence creates a foundation for how you not only do business but also for how you live your whole life if you don t value yourself don t feel good about who you are you will any of these sound familiar to you i can honestly say that i know these symptoms personally because i ve been there so today i really want to offer you a way to look at confidence in a different light and how you can use it s elements to empower yourself and boost your business so what are the most important elements when confidence is a concern here they are understanding these elements and using them consciously on a regular basis will not only make a huge difference in your business but will also put you into the driver s seat of your life so let s explore each element your childhood conditioningbelieve it or not your present level of confidence started being shaped in your childhood there are major components that shaped what i call your confidence foundation your thoughtsyour predominant thoughts are what create the next level of your confidence foundation thoughts can be tricky like diabetes on the surface nothing seems to be happening but underneath there is a lot going on you determine whether this is something that supports you or not if you mentally criticize and reprimand yourself often then that is the blueprint you are creating for it can work the opposite way if you choose to think predominantly supportive and positive thoughts of yourself the only difference will be the results you will get because you can t think supportive and destructive thoughts at the same time it s impossible your emotionswe have a very superficial understanding of emotions in our society because of this we don t really know how to use emotions effectively many women i come in contact with view emotions as simply good or bad and end up running away from those emotions that they perceived as being bad or negative that is where the problems begin because said in simple terms what you resist persists when dealing with your confidence the basic rule of thumb is the more you bottle up your emotions the less confidence you will have take this into consideration the second part of the picture is your ability to create emotionally how you want to feel or to be able to switch from a less desired emotional state to a desired one with ease so to sum it up there are two important components that matter in the realm of confidence building your wordsbeing the queen of words that i am i see so many people using their words so carelessly as if they didn t realize the potency the words have actually i believe many don t i have learned in more than one way the power that words possess and i have to say it wasn t always a pleasant experience once i learned that i have a choice to use my words to empower myself and others or i can disempower myself and others the choice i made was easy i chose to use my words to empower myself and my environment there are two types of words that have a dramatic effect on your level of confidence example of confidence building words absolutely positively certainly definitely of course sure naturallyexample of confidence leaking words try should hope but would could wish attempt which are you using the most in your day to day language your bodyyour body speaks volumes about you and how confident you are most of us just don t realize it consciously being a body worker for years i was blown away by how much information you can access from someone s body now i want to share what i found so you can use this info to increase your self confidence do you ever consciously look at the way you hold your body if you answered no then i want to suggest that you start doing so on a regular basis why because when you walk into a room or interact with people that is one of the first things people notice about you and based on what they see they make a value judgment about you what you might not realize right now is the fact that you can use your body as a tool to become a more confident person so how do you use your body to become more confident the key word we are going to use is posture what does a posture of confidence look like stand or walk with your what posture do you have and hold on a regular basis start paying attention and see how your posture matches your thoughts emotions and your words then change it consciously and see if anything shifts these are the elements that you can work with and get results by applying them to your
