two years ago i said that to the graduating class at stanford university when bill and i were invited to give link in i spent a long time thinking about what to say passing on wisdom to a few thousand young adults is a lot of responsibility my advice to let your heart break was based on the years i ve spent working in very poor communities sometimes the things you see are so sad and the solutions so far away that you have to resist trying to fix things admit that life can be unfair and feel the pain of it this is one way to build empathy i told the students and empathy ultimately leads to action and progress i still have to remind myself to turn toward suffering every time i see it it s not a natural thing to do and no one enjoys it but letting myself feel sorrow has made me a better advocate and philanthropist and probably a better human being last week at a link event in new york that coincided with the un general assembly writer and activist sisonke msimang told a story that added a new dimension to the notion of letting your heart break i encourage you to devote minutes to sisonke s story sometimes letting your heart break or as she says bearing witness doesn t just help us build empathy it also helps heal the suffering of others it is in sisonke s words a way to fix everything within us that is broken a way to change the world
