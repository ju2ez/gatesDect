link the exponential growth in digital technologies in the past years has revolutionised the market for the reproduction of art through digital means this applies to the visual arts in film of photography as well as in music re mastered versions of old and no so old movies of classic albums and of archetypal images in photography are all now common currency and the market for such images has been revolutionary but with this revolution has come a proliferation of terms to describe the various versions of the source material and for the wannabee collector of fine art reproductions for example it becomes increasingly vital to understand the genuine investment opportunity and the marketing driven hype so what are the terms currently in use to define the additional value of a classic or popular image or movie terms used in collectible popular culture include concepts such as special deluxe or limited edition these terms are often market driven selling the same basic product by marketing improved versions of film dvds music and video games that this can sometimes simply be a matter of adjusting the packaging has an implied danger of demeaning the idea of limited edition away from it s root meaning and value the term collector s edition is also used this again is a term which can be applied to various media such as books prints or recorded music and films but it can also apply to cars or motorcycles for example a collector s edition implies that the number of copies produced is restricted but the restriction can stop at a very high number indeed and this needs to be known and understood modern technology has changed the controls available to the concept of a limited edition in early days of printing and print reproduction of images traditional printmaking techniques could only produce a small number of top quality images before wear and tear on the plate especially in some etching techniques and in drypoint printing took it s toll this meant that longer print runs delivered passable but inferior quality images to limit the print run was a necessity which modern digital technology does not have to face thus it is important for would be collectors to research the provenance of any limited edition in the digital age naturally some collectors have a great desire to have all released editions of a personal favourite or a classic piece this in itself has its own value of course however where the need is to understand the intrinsic stand alone value of an individual limited edition item then the provenance becomes vital in assessing the investment value in the case of photographic reproductions the original artist s print carefully produced directly from his work and printed under the artists supervision are those which attract value over time the most common way of producing collectable prints in the modern digital era is to scan the original negative in the case of images from traditional photographic tools or balancing a digital file from a digital camera then output the image usually retouched on specially selected media types using archival inks thus very fine quality coated papers can be used to make delicate beautiful prints in defined limited numbers which can be certified and verified as authentic in this waylink genuine investment opportunities can be realised article tags link source link from articlesfactory com
