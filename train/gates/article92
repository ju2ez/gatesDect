this is one of two randall munroe books i ve read and it is by design the funnier of the pair it s a collection of posts from his blog link which is made up of cartoons he draws making fun of things mostly scientists and computers but lots of other things too there s one about link to reveal their discovery that life is arsenic based they research press conferences and find out that sometimes it s good to serve food that s related to the subject of the conference the last panel is all the reporters dead on the floor because they ate arsenic it s that kind of humor which not everybody loves but i do here s link of the other munroe book i ve read link where he takes absurd queries from what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground and uses them to explain scientific ideas he doesn t crack quite as many jokes as in link but it is very informative you ll learn about things like ballistics dna the oceans the atmosphere and lightning
