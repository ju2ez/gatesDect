in order to deliver vaccines immunization teams go door to door throughout the country including settlements in remote rural regions link before going into the field these teams use a process called microplanning to determine where they need to go in order to deliver the polio vaccine link before geographic information systems gis maps were made available through the mapping project hand drawn maps popularly known as cartoon maps were used to show the distribution of settlements these maps were drawn from memory and not based on real geographical data link gis combines satellites mobile device and mapping software capabilities to capture analyze and present data as legible and informative maps link the imagery of states is downloaded and organized for local government area lga and ward map creation link these maps make it possible to read distance and proximity with realistic placement of mapping features to ensure that all settlements and hamlets are visited by vaccination teams and the correct number and type of teams are deployed link phones are loaded with tracking software and the final settlement list before the vaccination teams are sent out in the field link these vaccination teams are using tracking devices in the field the phones collect geo location readings through gps link the data from the phones is then processed in the gis lab link detailed analytics report tracking results for each settlement link these results make it easy to identify which settlements were missed and need to be revisited link link
