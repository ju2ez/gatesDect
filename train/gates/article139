the chronicle sat down with mr gates in an exclusive interview monday to talk about his vision for how colleges can be transformed through technology his approach is not simply to drop in tablet computers or other gadgets and hope change happens a model he said has a really horrible track record instead the foundation awards grants to reformers working to fix inefficiencies in the current model of higher education that keep many students from graduating on time or at all and he argues for radical reform of college teaching advocating a move toward a flipped classroom where students watch videos from superstar professors as homework and use class time for group projects and other interactive activities as he put it having a lot of kids sit in the lecture class will be viewed at some point as an antiquated thing the microsoft founder doesn t claim to have all the answers in fact he describes the foundation s process as one of continual refinement to learn make mistakes try new things out find new partners to do things the interview comes on the eve of mr gates s keynote speech at an event tuesday to celebrate the th anniversary of the morrill act which created the nationwide system of land grant colleges the convocation will be held in washington d c sponsored by the association of public land grant universities below a complete transcript of the conversation link if you re engaged in some inefficient practice maybe that s a bad thing link link link just giving people devices has a really horrible track record link link even though i only have a high school degree i m a professional student link link link link link link link for us our role is different than that our role is to make sure that the universities that are out there that already have a lot of professors a lot of real estate a lot of reputation that if there s ways that they can do things better like looking at their completion rates and saying ok what are the best practices and seeing a student who seems to be disengaged what do you to do to get them re engaged even these top universities often only have a percent completion rate and the average university will have something like a percent completion rate so you have an immense amount of wasted resource and students who end up with a big loan and sort of a negative experience in terms of their own self confidence and so that failing student is a disaster for everyone and yet there s been surprisingly little put into finding out who does it well even universities knowing their completion rates it s only been recently with some things we and others have gotten behind that there have been standard metrics and a willingness to share what is actually a fairly embarrassing statistic for these universities and be able to say if somebody s got percent what are they doing is it the pool of people they bring in or what they re doing when they get there link our goal is pretty simple seeing the u s education system as a real gem as the thing that s provided broad opportunity and made the country do very well and so the question is how do we renew that when others have looked at what we do well and copied a lot of those things and so their universities are getting a lot better their completion rates are better than ours their efficiency rates are better than ours the number of students who go into science and math are better than ours what is it that we need to do to strengthen this fundamental part of our country that both in a broad sort of economic level and an individual rights level is the key enabler and it s amazing how little effort s been put into this of saying ok why are some teachers at any different level way better than others you ve got universities in this country with a percent completion rate why is it that they don t come under pressure to change what they re doing to come up with a better way of doing things so if casting light on the current state of the system is a good thing then we re a positive change and if not then people could feel differently link take remedial math which is an absolute disaster what destroys more self confidence than any other educational thing in america is being assigned to some remedial math when you get into some college and then it s not taught very well and you end up with this sense of hey i can t really figure those things out if we can take and bring the right technical things and people things to that then that would make a huge difference so all the grants are to people in universities and yes some people in universities disagree with other people in universities but if you have a sense that completion is a good thing then you re all eventually going to come to a consensus that yes we can improve link link link yes universities are somewhat reluctant to give up a piece so it s not clear who those innovators will be but i think its time is coming link but the device is not the key limiting factor at this point at least in most countries if we ever get the curriculum to be super super good then the access piece which is the most expensive part will be challenging requiring special policies to let people get access the device you ll be able to check out of the library a portable pc so i don t see that as the key thing right now link in higher ed there s a part of it that has been extremely strong in the u s the best in the world you know it hasn t been easy for other people to do what we ve done well but for the first time now we see them doing some of those things the top universities in china like tsinghua is a world class university absolutely in the top universities in the world so we have to double down particularly when there s new opportunity which technology is bringing and when there s a challenge which all these budget issues are pretty dramatic in that regard so there s nothing more catalytic there s nothing that was more important to me in terms of the kind of opportunity i had personally i went to a great high school i went to a great university i only went three years but it doesn t matter it was still extremely valuable to me to be in that environment and i had fantastic professors throughout that whole thing and so if every kid could have that kind of education we d achieve a lot of goals both at the individual and country level link link
