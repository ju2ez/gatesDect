i took a lot of math classes in college i remember professor shlomo sternberg getting up on the first day of his class and telling us we weren t going to see any numbers other than and i had a great time in that one jordan ellenberg the author of link studied under sternberg but i think i d like his book even if we didn t have that in common on the surface it s about math but it s really about how much math plays into our daily lives without our even knowing it the book starts with a story about abraham wald an eastern european mathematician who worked for the american government during world war ii one day the military came to him and said we have a problem we send our planes overseas and when they come back their engines are fine but their tails are riddled with bullet holes if we put more armor on the tails though the planes get too heavy to fly can you help us figure out how to protect the planes tails better and he said no they were surprised but then he explained that they were asking the wrong question you need to put more armor where there link bullet holes clearly when the plane gets hit in the tail it makes it back to you your problem is the planes that get hit in the engine because those are the ones that aren t coming back ultimately that s really what the book is a series of stories about how a lot of the apparently non mathematical systems that underpin our daily lives are actually deeply mathematical and people couldn t develop them until they started asking the right questions each chapter starts somewhere that seems fairly straightforward electoral politics say or the massachusetts lottery and then uses that as a jumping off point to talk about the math involved in some places the math gets quitelink complicated ellenberg deals with cutting edge thinking about subjects like prime numbers extra dimensions and relative infinities a non mathematician might get a little lost along the way but even if you don t feel like following him all the way to the bottom of things like fano planes dimensional spheres and condorcet s paradox after he goes really deep he always comes back to make sure you re still with him the way he deals with the lottery is a great example for several years the massachusetts lottery ran in a way that allowed three teams one led by an mit student one by a medical researcher and one by a guy from michigan to game the system and win millions of dollars you might ask how could the state let them cheat like that for so long part of the answer is the state didn t care massachusetts got cents for every lottery ticket sold no matter who won and the second part of the answer is they weren t cheating they were taking advantage of math to give themselves slightly better odds at winning and other people slightly worse odds they basically turned themselves into the house at a casino but ellenberg extends his analysis even further because while two of the teams just had the quic pic machine choose their numbers randomly the team of students filled out its tickets by hand tens of thousands of tickets every time they played ellenberg has mathematical explanations for the difference filling out the tickets by hand exposed the students to less risk of losing money in any given week and then points out that if you re on a student s budget the thought of losing any money at all is pretty scary toward the end of each chapter ellenberg broadens from these specific examples to a series of questions about how link some of the ideas in the chapter might be used what kinds of mathematical questions are left to answer and what kinds of real life problems they might eventually solve given how black and white so much of our political dialogue has become i think it s great to have somebody advocating for looking at the numbers explaining the relative costs of things like alternative tax policies or what happens when you implement different voting strategies even if you don t follow the deepest math behind these things you can still appreciate the argument and the rigor of the thinking and the world can always use more rigorous thinking the writing is funny smooth and accessible not what you might expect from a book about math what ellenberg has written is ultimately a love letter to math if the stories he tells add up to a larger lesson it s that to do mathematics is to be at once touched by fire and bound by reason and that there are ways in which we re link doing math all the time
