whenever i hang out with warren buffett i feel like a kid in a candy store and not just because of his famous sweet tooth one of the first times he came to visit in seattle our kids were stunned when they saw him chowing down oreos for breakfast we ve been close friends for more than years and we have just as much fun together now as we did when we first met in all that time we have never run out of things to talk about and laugh about so when we got together in omaha during this year s berkshire hathaway shareholder meeting we decided to check out a real candy store actually although the link has just about every kind of sweet you can imagine it is much more than a candy store it s also an old fashioned soda shop used record store vintage memorabilia shop and pinball museum we had a blast reminiscing about our favorite treats melinda s and my special history with willie nelson why pinball machines were the best business warren ever had and a lot more take a look
