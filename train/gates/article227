my family and i visited belize and mexico s yucatan peninsula recently for a family vacation we had a relaxing time together enjoying the good weather and beautiful beaches we also had a chance to visit some of the mayan archaeological sites such as chichen itza and lamani explore belize s aquatic caves and go snorkeling in hopes of seeing the amazing whale sharks which were migrating off the coast on their way to their feeding grounds i d never been to the yucatan before it was a great place for a family vacation with spectacular scenery terrific beaches and remarkable archaeological sites link yucatan and belize along with guatemala and honduras were home to the mayan civilization which lasted more than years they left behind these pyramid like temples many sites of their cities and temples have never been excavated link we visited two major mayan sites chechen itza in the yucatan and lamanai in belize link the mayans carefully tracked the movements of celestial bodies and developed a calendar that was actually more accurate than european calendars of the time they knew that a year was and one quarter days long their temples were aligned to the sun so that on solstices the architecture would do cool things like cast the shadow of a snake which was worshipped at chichen itza link we also visited xel ha park it s an amazing place where they ve taken a natural inlet and created cool touristy things you can do like walk on a rope bridge and play with dolphins in the water link i had been to belize before and enjoyed visiting it again it s a former british colony where english is spoken and the economy is based largely on aquaculture agriculture and increasingly tourism the population is growing because the economy is fairly strong link belize is interesting geologically it has what s called karst topography thick layers of limestone which is a mineral deposit that can erode to form caves there are places where rivers run through the caves some of them a mile long which you can explore in tubes as we did link we also visited lighthouse reef an atoll where the former lighthouse has fallen down but the remains are still there with gps lighthouses are basically obsolete today but they re kind of cool historically link in belize we went snorkeling with divers to see the whale sharks which are very unusual we didn t actually see any when we went snorkeling as a family but my daughter and a friend got lucky when they went and saw one come up they re amazing creatures they re almost as big as whales some are feet or bigger and they eat krill like baleen whales but they re sharks link
