link i much appreciate bill s thoughtful review of link he points to a central question what will fuel transportation in the future in the aftermath of the s energy crises a sharp division emerged between oil and other energy sources in much of the world oil was squeezed out of electric generation and primarily became a transportation fuel thus when one talks about wind and solar today that has very little to do with transportation transportation and electric generation as bill observes are two separate worlds with very little trade between them autos have become much more efficient over the last few decades and will become more efficient in the years ahead nevertheless the challenge of fueling the world s growing population of cars will be huge i try to phrase the problem simply in link how will the world cope in terms of energy in going from an auto population of billion cars to billion the most obvious answer is by becoming more efficient and that will certainly be the case where in the united states for instance the new car will go from about miles per gallon today to miles per gallon by early in the next decade but that still implies oil as a fuel over the past decade we have seen a sequence of initiatives to reduce oil dependence in transportation hydrogen biofuels electric car natural gas vehicles biofuels have made an impact in the united states on a volumetric basis they constitute almost percent of motor fuel but there is a clear limit with ethanol and the other first generation biofuels the second generation of biofuels is proving harder to attain than anticipated by some a few years ago link link link link from today s vantage point electricity seems destined to play a larger role in transportation in the years ahead wide dispersion of electric vehicles would break down the wall between transportation and electric generation and reduce the market share of oil but informed expectations vary widely as to whether the electric car will be a niche vehicle or a mass market product and it will probably be five to years before that is clear battery innovation and cost are key but now there is a new competitor or rather another old competitor with new vigor natural gas in some parts of the world natural gas has long been an alternative fuel what is new is the north american shale gas revolution its prospect of abundant volumes of low cost natural gas has made natural gas a new contender in the transportation market given current costs it does appear that natural gas will expand its role in fueling fleets of buses and delivery and service trucks and could well gain share for large long distance trucks but the need and cost for refueling infrastructure constitute a major barrier to wide use in motor cars all this leads to a very interesting question will natural gas gain share in transportation going directly into fuel tanks or by generating electricity that goes into electric vehicles both natural gas and coal are converted into liquids in a few situations around the world today but the costs and energy costs raise major barriers to any notable expansion for instance china has stepped back from what were a few years ago ambitious targets for coal to liquids the reason was cost so all of this turns attention back to the importance of continuing to improve the energy efficiency of automobiles and gives very strong impetus to the now familiar hybrid technology as a key enabler but there is still that basic challenge of billion cars economic growth and rising incomes are what will propel the world from billion to billion cars that is a massive growth moving down that road will require a good deal of innovation along the various avenues that bill described in his review link the prize the epic quest for oil money and powerlink the quest energy security and the remaking of the modern worldlink
