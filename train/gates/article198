once in a while you meet someone whose work is so extraordinary you want to share their story so others can learn from their experience that s how i feel about cheryl hyman cheryl is the chancellor of the city colleges of chicago one of the largest two year community college systems in the us when she was appointed chancellor in she was handed a daunting task fix a college that was failing to educate the community it served more than percent of her students most of them from low income backgrounds arrived unprepared for the rigors of college most of them dropped out cheryl s challenge was an extreme version of the problem facing america s higher education system college enrollment has increased dramatically in the last few decades but graduation rates have not nationally about percent of college students complete degrees at city colleges of chicago just percent were graduating you can listen to cheryl explain more about the challenges she faced in this short video it was not the first time the odds were against cheryl raised in the housing projects in the west side of chicago cheryl dealt with hardship at an early age her parents struggled with substance abuse when she was looking to escape the chaos of her home life cheryl moved out quit high school and got a job working at a fast food restaurant for a time while trying to make ends meet on her own she was homeless she quickly realized that working at a fast food restaurant was not a path to better life but a quality education would be she went back to high school graduated and then eventually spent two years at the city colleges of chicago before transferring to the illinois institute of technology where she earned a degree in computer science after graduation she got her first job at comed illinois s largest electric company working her way up to become a corporate vice president in she got a call from then chicago mayor richard m daley asking her to lead the city s network of seven community colleges and help more of the city s youth succeed like she had she was later reappointed by current chicago mayor rahm emanuel cheryl s appointment wasn t without controversy she didn t have a formal background in education and her business minded passion for measurement often shook up long held traditions in higher education chery didn t give up instead she instituted sweeping reforms to help more students graduate i was impressed by three critical changes she made there are many stories of the students who have benefitted from these improvements one of them is lidia sanchez who moved to chicago from mexico and is the first person in her family to hold a degree it wasn t always easy she says but thanks to advising support she received she was able to graduate with a culinary arts degree last month she now works in the kitchens of two of chicago s top restaurants and has ambitions of managing her own restaurant someday one by one these individual stories of success are adding up to positive changes at city college of chicago the graduation rate has doubled since to percent and for the last three years the school has awarded the highest number of degrees in its history much more work of course needs to be done as cheryl told me she won t be satisfied until her graduation rate is percent still the progress made by cheryl already a reminder that change is possible in higher education picking leaders like chancellor hyman is a big part of that change she s setting a fantastic example that more people need to hear about now that i ve shared it i hope you will too
