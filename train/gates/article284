i m a big fan of america s investments in the health and well being of the world s poor unfortunately not everyone feels the same way in fact some in washington d c have proposed dramatic cuts in foreign assistance that would be a terrible mistake last month i wrote about how link in this post i want to show how smart health and development programs promote america s economy and how cutting back on these investments could backfire on american workers as i said in my link these security and economic arguments aren t what inspired melinda and me to get involved in global health what inspired us was the chance to save children from dying of preventable diseases but over the years i ve come to see the connection to america s security and economy as well i start from the simple premise that everyone is better off when there are more middle income countries in the world as a country climbs up the economic ladder you see concrete improvements in the lives of its people richer countries are less likely to go to war and more capable of link and they can afford to buy more products from other countries including the united states here s one example from my experience with microsoft from our earliest days we intended to expand into markets beyond the united states in we chose tokyo for the site of our first foreign office that bet paid off phenomenally well for a time we sold more software in japan than anywhere else you may be thinking link an ambitious software company would want a foothold in japan but it wasn t always so obvious just a few decades before we opened our tokyo office japan had been devastated by world war ii its economy and infrastructure lay in ruins how did they recover among other things through smart aid programs from the united states and others by the s japan s economy was booming and the country presented a great opportunity for companies like us to this day sales there are a key part of microsoft s success and these sales have produced many jobs in japan and america alike microsoft s experience in japan is part of a larger trend that s still going on today as more countries join the ranks of the middle class countless u s companies are doing business in places that used to get american aid but have become self sufficient including south korea brazil mexico vietnam and thailand here s another way that u s investments abroad help american businesses by connecting them directly with new customers and suppliers america s chief aid agency usaid uses its expertise to encourage private companies to collaborate on projects for example they have worked with cargill and land o lakes to help dairy farmers in east africa raise their productivity increasing the value of the companies exports to places like kenya and uganda as the companies ceos link this benefits not only the farmers in africa but food producers and their workers in the united states and it promotes goodwill in a part of the world that can be a market for more american goods in the future usaid link walmart to train thousands of women farmers in sub saharan africa and with starbucks keurig and others to help coffee farmers in latin america improve their crops so they can join the global market these and other efforts are part of america s global economic leadership pulling back now would mean retreating from the world stage at a time when other countries are doubling down on their investments it would deprive american companies of potential new markets and make them less competitive while also harming the health and productivity of some of the poorest people in the world it wouldn t be robbing peter to pay paul it would be robbing peter and then robbing paul too so it s good for the american economy when other countries join the middle class but how much credit does aid deserve for making that happen it s a hard question to answer growth has many causes my own conclusion based on years of looking at the evidence and discussing it with experts is that although aid may not directly cause growth there is a strong indirect connection between the two moving to the middle class requires a strong education system and good infrastructure nutrition and healthcare and smart targeted aid can promote those things pretty effectively fighting aids for example saves lives and it increases productivity because societies are stronger when they have healthy teachers police officers and entrepreneurs countries that worked with pepfar america s phenomenally successful effort to slow the aids epidemic link on one measure of economic development than their non pepfar counterparts their link also grew quickly between and for example tanzania s per person income went up more than percent zambia s went up percent ethiopia s rose percent and as these countries grew so did their appetite for american goods in the same time frame u s exports to tanzania rose by link u s exports to zambia went up link and to ethiopia link many other countries are making similar gains the point is not that aid directly makes poor people richer it s that aid helps create a foundation for growth along with many other factors it helps remove some of the barriers that keep people from making the most of their talents and when people in one place do better the rest of us do better too we can build on this progress if the united states helps maintain the momentum investments in aid which account for less than percent of the federal budget are an essential part of the solution we need to keep making them on behalf of americans and people around the world
