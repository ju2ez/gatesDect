this last weekend i attended the berkshire hathaway annual meeting in omaha often called woodstock for capitalists this year s meeting drew investors and their families who came to learn from warren buffett and charlie munger and participate in an institution unique in the world of business i ve been on the board of berkshire hathaway since late this is my eighth annual meeting and i think it was one of the best the centerpiece of the meeting is the question and answer session that charlie and warren host for five and a half hours they answered questions from attendees at the convention center three business analysts and a panel of three journalists i counted questions by any measure that s amazing link the addition of the panel of industry analysts was new this year and i thought it added a lot to the session this year seemed to be particularly substantive in terms of the questions asked warren and charlie answered questions about succession planning for berkshire their views on the management of risk in their insurance business taxes and politics and the outlook for the economy any time i m lucky enough to spend time with warren i come away learning something and this weekend that was certainly the case even though the fundamentals of his investing advice and management philosophy haven t really changed it s inspiring to watch someone as smart thoughtful and principled as warren talk about the world of business he is also a master at promoting his companies and this year was no exception berkshire hathaway recently bought the omaha herald newspaper and so warren invited me to a newspaper throwing competition just before the saturday meeting i was a paperboy growing up but i didn t do as well as warren as we lobbed omaha herald newspapers in front of a large gathering of media onto the porch of a clayton modular home also a berkshire company set up in the exhibition center i think warren had been practicing link the next day i fared somewhat better in a ping pong exhibition with ariel hsing i met ariel seven years ago when she was and was brought in to destroy warren and me in ping pong at his link birthday party she s been playing ping pong at the berkshire meetings since she was now she s and will be part of the u s olympic ping pong team in london i held my own for a while but she creamed me when she brought her real game i think i did a bit better than warren that exhibition match was placed in front of borsheims the berkshire jewelry store where warren played salesperson later in the day link a big part of the annual meeting is catching up with friends who come out to omaha for it and i got a chance to spend some time with bono who was there as well it was a great chance to get an update on his work with link and link and to talk about africa he s been such a tremendous advocate for africa it was good to hear his perspective on conditions there and to talk about my recent trip to ethiopia and zambia we both share a concern about cuts in foreign aid budgets in the wealthy world that could have a devastating impact on health and development in africa link i also managed to get some time to talk to liz claman from fox business news and becky quick of cnbc warren and i also got to play some bridge along with other berkshire shareholders and i ate at a couple of warren s favorite restaurants in omaha link all in all it was a terrific trip and one i look forward to every year no less than the thousands of other people who make the pilgrimage to omaha to learn from this remarkable business leader and teacher
