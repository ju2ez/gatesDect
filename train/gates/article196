like most people i don t think i can be easily fooled but that s just what happened when i was asked to taste a chicken taco and tell whether the meat inside was real or fake the meat certainly had the look and the smell of chicken i took a bite and it had the taste and texture of real chicken too but i was surprised to learn that there wasn t an ounce of real chicken it the meat was made entirely of plants and yet i couldn t tell the difference what i was experiencing was more than a clever meat substitute it was a taste of the future of food by the world s population will grow to more than billion and our appetite for meat will grow along with it the demand for meat will have doubled between and link this is happening in large part because economies are growing and people can afford more meat that s all good news but raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact put simply there s no way to produce enough meat for billion people yet we can t ask everyone to become vegetarians as much as i like vegetables i know i wouldn t want to give up hamburgers one of my favorite foods that s why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources some exciting new companies are taking on this challenge they are creating plant based alternatives to chicken ground beef even eggs that are produced more sustainably and taste great to see how food scientists are able to use plants to create meat alternatives watch this video to be sure this pioneering research is still very new but the meat alternatives available now show great promise companies like link and link are experimenting with new ways to use heat and pressure to turn plants into foods that look and taste just like meat and eggs the chicken taco i ate was made using beyond meat s chicken alternative i wasn t the only one fooled by how real it tasted new york times food writer mark bittman couldn t tell the difference between beyond meat and real chicken either you can read his review link still taste is subjective michael pollan author of the omnivore s dilemma was not so impressed with the meat alternatives currently available he link that while these innovative products have great potential a lot more work needs to be done to improve the quality i also tasted beyond eggs hampton creek foods egg substitute which doesn t contain the high cholesterol of real eggs if you re interested in tasting these meat alternatives my friend nathan myhrvold asked the chefs at his link to create some recipes with beyond meat s chicken free product they cooked chicken free tikka masala link and link and grilled chicken free strips and vegetable salad with sunflower seed pesto link and link try them for yourself i think you ll discover that you can create a nutritious protein rich meal that s good for you and the environment you ll be surprised it s not the real thing
