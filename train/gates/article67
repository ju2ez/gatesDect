i ve recently discovered that i have a lot in common with a funny dyslexic transgender actor comedian escape artist unicyclist ultra marathoner and pilot from great britain except all of the above eddie izzard is one of my favorite performers melinda and i had the pleasure of seeing one of his comedy shows live in london and then we got to talk with him backstage after the show so i was excited to pick up his autobiography link it was there that i learned for the first time that izzard and i share a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as a child eddie was nerdy awkward and incompetent at flirting with girls he had terrible handwriting he was good at math he was highly motivated to learn everything he could about subjects that interested him he left college at age to pursue his professional dreams he had a loving mom who died of cancer way too young i can relate to every one of these things you might find you share similarities with eddie as well in fact that s the overarching point of this book we re all cut from the same cloth in his words we are all totally different but we are all exactly the same if you ve never seen eddie perform his stand up routine you re missing out like monty python he often draws from real historical figures such as shakespeare or charlemagne and comes up with hilarious riffs many of them improvised and like other super talented comedians like robin williams and tom hanks he s also great in serious dramatic roles he recently appeared in the movie link with dame judi dench he even talks semi seriously about running for parliament despite all those gifts i m not sure i d recommend this book for those who ve never seen eddie perform there are some comedians such as david sedaris and george carlin whose books would make perfect sense even if you haven t seen their act that s not the case here you have to witness his brand of surreal intellectual self deprecating humor otherwise it will be like you re walking into the middle of a conversation but if you have seen eddie s stuff and you like it link a riff on pavlov s dogs i promise you ll love this book you ll see that his written voice is very similar to his stage voice you ll also see that the book provides not just laugh out loud moments but also a lot of touching insights into how little edward izzard a kid with only a hint of performing talent became an international star the book begins with the event that had by far the biggest impact on his life the death of his mom in when eddie was just six years old eddie s father an accountant who traveled a lot for work was not able to care for eddie and his brother by himself so the izzard boys were sent off to a boarding school near a welsh seaside resort where you d expect a few dead bodies to wash up occasionally but no such luck imagine you re six years old you ve just lost your mom you re starting to have gender identity issues that make no sense to you and you re packed away to a boarding school where you have to cry yourself to sleep as hard as these experiences were there s no way eddie would be the star he is today if they hadn t happened i do believe i started performing and doing all sorts of big crazy ambitious things because on some childlike magical thinking level i thought doing those things might bring her back but she never came back i keep trying though just in case he s honest about the fact that he was the opposite of a natural instead of innate talent he had something perhaps more important a burning desire to be in show business and the propensity to be relentless in pursuit of his goals he spent most of the s working as a street performer often in london s covent garden it was a slog with a lot of embarrassing moments but he got much better the old fashioned way by working at it day in and day out and learning from his many failures in fact i couldn t help but think that eddie s life would be a perfect case study for the stanford psychologist link who has written about the concept of the growth mindset as dweck explains link link the growth mindset is one in which you believe that your capabilities derive from practice and perseverance rather than dna and destiny eddie has the growth mindset in spades being lousy at something doesn t stop him from doing it in fact it often has the opposite effect driving him to work at it until he is no longer terrified of it not only did he apply that to performing in front of huge audiences despite his fundamental shyness that growth mindset also drove him to become a pilot despite his fear of heights it drove him to run marathons in days despite his lack of natural athleticism and it drove him to start performing stand up in french german arabic russian and spanish despite the difficulty of learning these languages and translating his british humor into other cultural contexts maybe most difficult of all that growth mindset allowed him to walk out the door of his home in in makeup and a dress despite opening himself up to ridicule and hate but doing so was liberating it led to a world i could begin to change in my own personal way carving out for myself a small slice of freedom of expression i m always impressed by the growth mindset when i see it in action now that i understand how much it s at the core of eddie s brilliance on stage i ve become an even more devoted fan of his
