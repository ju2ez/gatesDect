nearly three years ago indian prime minister narendra modi made one of the boldest comments on public health that i have ever heard from an elected official it s still having a big impact today he made the comment during his first speech to the nation commemorating india s independence day modi said we are living in the st century has it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in the open the poor womenfolk of the village wait for the night until darkness descends they can t go out to defecate what bodily torture they must be feeling how many diseases that act might engender can t we make arrangements for toilets for the dignity of our mothers and sisters i can t think of another time when a national leader has broached such a sensitive topic so frankly and so publicly even better modi backed up his words with actions two months after that speech he launched a campaign called clean india swachh bharat in hindi which now includes ending open defecation nationwide by installing million toilets throughout the country million and making sure that no untreated waste is dumped into the environment on my most recent visit to india i made a short virtual reality video about this amazing undertaking if you re wondering why the prime minister would put a spotlight on a subject that most of us would rather not even think about take a look at the statistics of the million people worldwide who die from unsafe water sanitation and hygiene each year more than are in india a quarter of young girls there drop out of school because there s no decent toilet available when you factor in the deaths sickness and lost opportunity poor sanitation costs india more than billion a year in other words solving this problem will save hundreds of thousands of lives every year help girls stay in school and boost the country s economy improving sanitation is a big focus for our foundation and we re working closely with the indian government in support of its goals there are two keys to achieving the targets of clean india one involves giving everyone access to a well managed toilet which means all the waste is treated either on site or in a treatment facility to remove the pathogens that make people sick it s crucial to get the entire process right from containing the waste in a toilet to collecting it transporting it if necessary and treating it if one link in the chain fails people still get sick unfortunately in many places it s not feasible to lay down sewer pipes or build treatment facilities that s why indian researchers are testing a variety of new tools including redesigned toilets that don t require sewer systems and advanced ways to treat human waste so far the progress is impressive in when clean india began just percent of indians had access to proper sanitation today percent do and the government has a detailed plan to finish the job by october the link anniversary of mahatma gandhi s birth officials know which states are on track and which are lagging behind thanks to a robust reporting system that includes photographing and geotagging each newly installed toilet but giving people access to toilets isn t enough you also have to persuade them to use the toilets that s the second key to clean india and in some ways it is even harder than the first people can be reluctant to change old habits clean india has ingenious ways of tackling that problem in some communities groups of children band together to call out people who are defecating in the open and encourage them to use public toilets instead in a pilot project that will be expanded next year the government worked with google so users in cities could search online for the nearest public toilets get directions and read reviews by other users on streets throughout the country billboards remind passers by of the mission stars from bollywood films and cricket teams speak out on tv and radio even india s currency features the swachh bharat logolink the hard work is paying off today more than percent of indian villages have been declared free of open defecation up from percent in you can track the progress on link what i love most about clean india is that it identified a big problem got everyone working on it and is using measurement to show where things need to be done differently as the old saying goes what gets measured gets done if you don t set ambitious targets and chart your progress you end up settling for business as usual and in this case business as usual would mean poor sanitation keeps killing more than half a million indians every year by aiming high the people of india are demanding change and they are taking action to make it happen it is a great example for other countries and an inspiration for all of us who believe everyone deserves a chance at a healthy productive life
