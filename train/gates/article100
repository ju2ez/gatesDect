my guess is that you haven t spent a whole lot of time wondering what would happen if you pitched a baseball at percent of the speed of light i haven t either but that s okay because randall munroe has figured it out and explained it really clearly in his book link it s a collection of some of his favorite posts from link of the two blogs he keeps his first blog link which he s also turned into a book is made up of cartoons he draws making fun of things mostly scientists and computers but lots of other things too there s link about scientists holding a press conference to reveal their discovery that life is arsenic based they research press conferences and find out that sometimes it s good to serve food that s related to the subject of the conference link link may not be quite as funny as link but it s a lot more interesting the subtitle of the book is serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions and that s exactly what it is people write munroe with questions that range over all fields of science physics chemistry biology questions like from what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground the answer it turns out is high enough that it would disintegrate before it hit the ground another question what would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube shaped bricks where each brick was made of the corresponding element to which the answer is essentially the human race would be wiped out munroe s explanations are funny too he ll use giraffes as a unit of height measurement and draw pictures of ten giraffes standing on top of each other nevertheless the explanations are scientifically valid and they re very well researched with citations of obscure papers like sexual cannibalism in orb weaving spiders an economic model actually that one is from the website but i assume it ll make it into the sequel which i hope will be called link or the next one link he verifies his facts by calling expert scientists all over the world and i have to imagine those conversations are amazing the reason munroe s approach is a great way to learn about science is that he takes ideas that everybody understands in a general way and then explores what happens when you take those ideas to their limits for example we all know pretty much what gravity is but what if earth s gravity were twice as strong as it is what if it were three times as strong or a hundred looking at the question in that way makes you start to think about gravity a little differently here s another example it turns out that if you have a glass that s literally half empty the top half water and the bottom half a perfect vacuum the glass shatters and the pieces fly up to the ceiling but munroe doesn t just say the glass shatters he goes through every step of the process so that you understand link the glass shatters the suction squeezing together the glass and the water which by the way is boiling is so powerful that it actually lifts the glass off the table when the glass and the water finally meet the water is moving downward quickly enough that the shock breaks the bottom of the glass meanwhile the glass is moving upward quickly enough that the broken pieces fly up to the ceiling munroe concludes if the optimist says the glass is half full and the pessimist says the glass is half empty the physicist ducks so if you re dying to know how fast you can drive over a speed bump and still live or how many legos it would take to build a bridge from london to new york or whether we could make the moon change colors by pointing every single laser pointer on earth at it you re in luck not only do you have a place to go for the answers but you ll also learn about a lot of other things like ballistics dna the oceans the atmosphere and lightning and when to duck if the glass is half full
