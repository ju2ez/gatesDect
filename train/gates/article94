last week in paris i got to be part of a link about energy and climate several governments and private investors came together to make major commitments for funding clean energy research this is a big focus for me because providing more energy for the poor is essential for fighting poverty and because switching to link energy is essential for stopping climate change but energy is not the only factor that affects how much carbon we pump into the atmosphere i recently read an excellent book about another key factor how we make stuff the book is called link by a team at the university of cambridge led by researchers julian allwood and jonathan cullen you can download it free on link although the book is probably too detailed for most general readers its pages are filled with dense diagrams and a lot of numbers the authors conclusions are well worth understanding they focus on the five materials that account for more than half of the world s industrial carbon emissions steel cement paper plastic and aluminum as i ve link it s impossible to imagine a modern world without these materials every year for example we produce more than pounds of steel for every person on earth nearly half of which goes into buildings and demand for all these materials will roughly double by as the world s population grows and more people join the global middle class yet producing this stuff contributes significantly to climate change and also creates other risks like reducing the supply of drinkable water and land that could be used for growing food the question boils down to this how can we meet the growing demand for materials without destroying the environment the authors start by asking whether we can get a big enough reduction in greenhouse gases simply by producing these materials more efficiently they re looking for a percent reduction i think we need to get to at least percent by and eventually percent but either way you re talking about a big cut unfortunately efficiency gains on their own won t be enough the problem is that demand is going to double by mid century suppose you make widgets and you invent a way to cut your carbon emissions by percent per widget if you start making twice as many widgets your overall emissions will still go up by percent the authors call this approach thinking only about efficiency gains looking with one eye open how do you look with both eyes open by also studying how you could use less material to begin with make products that last longer reuse or recycle them or avoid using the service the material provides the authors argue that by looking with both eyes open both using less stuff and making stuff more efficiently it should be possible to cut emissions in half without asking people to make big sacrifices i was surprised to learn how many opportunities there are to reduce overall use of materials for example although i knew about basic recycling efforts like collecting aluminum cans at the office i hadn t realized how much reuse is possible at an industrial level the authors argue that when a product say a building or car is discarded the materials in it are often still usable reusing is much better than recycling because recycling takes yet more energy if you throw out your old refrigerator the steel is probably still in good condition so is the steel in old buildings as long as there hasn t been a fire or earthquake it could be reused if you could take it apart easily and get it to someone who wanted that shape but matching up buyers and sellers is hard who has the time to look around for someone who might want pieces of your old refrigerator this is an area where technology can help we can put digital stamps on products so we can track their history and digital markets can match supply with demand there are other intriguing ideas too like finding ways to make buildings that are dismantled instead of demolished so we could reuse more of the stuff they re made of although the book isn t aimed at a general audience the authors keep things lively with colorful illustrations and funny analogies i ve read other books about steel but none of them featured a photo of the link exhibit in nebraska i ve read a lot of books about physics but i don t remember seeing such an extended riff on how atoms act like people dancing in a nightclub link the book s message is clear and convincing we can t go on using materials the way we have been for the past years but fortunately we don t have to we can meet the world s growing need for the stuff of modern life avoid the worst effects of climate change and preserve the environment for future generations
