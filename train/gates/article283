link link link link link link link in november i visited a village in mali and sat with a gathering of village residents on benches that had been pulled together for the meeting one bench was for blind people and there was one young man only years of age who had been blind for years blind for over half of his life the people in that village were very sophisticated about onchocerciasis they knew that their children would never have to put up with this cause of blindness and they were grateful the visit helped those of us who spend time in meetings thinking about policy or writing papers it helped us to be grounded to see the impact of the mectizan program on people but it was also a chance for the villagers to become connected to see merck employees and to know that medicine doesn t just appear in a village by magic they saw the faces of people who spend their days worrying about schedules and customs about dosage and packaging about storage and records we were reminded that we live in an interdependent world where it takes the whole world to raise a healthy child what led up to that meeting in mali and where does one start history is always a book that we begin in the middle however we must begin someplace it was in that onchocerciasis was first described it was in that the life cycle was finally understood and it was in that the onchocerciasis control program was established by world health organization who that is a story in itself but the story took a leap forward in when merck researcher william campbell went to see roy vagelos head of the merck research labs with the idea that ivermectin being used to prevent heartworm in dogs might have an impact on onchocerciasis in humans it would take millions of dollars to determine if that was true and the potential market was small roy vagelos decided to approve the proposal it is hard to reconstruct the ethos of this company where the founders son george merck declared we try never to forget that medicine is for the people it is not for profits and if we have remembered that they have never failed to appear add to that roy vagelos and you have an understanding of what followed in february the first human tests were conducted at the university of dakar by the results were so encouraging that phase ii studies began and by phase iii studies on patients in ghana and liberia had determined optimal dosing in papers were filed in france for regulatory approval roy vagelos tried to find a way to distribute the drug he went to who and found himself overwhelmed by the bureaucracy then to usaid usaid was not interested on oct at press conferences in washington and paris merck said it would supply mectizan for the treatment of river blindness to everyone who needed it for as long as necessary at no charge that is as important in the history of global health as the breaching of the berlin wall was to democracy john maynard keynes once said the day is not far off when the economic problems will take a back seat to our real problems he was talking about human relations behavior health and religion maybe oct was that day the moment when a corporation had the audacity to make social need more important than profits to make a commitment that went beyond what could actually be seen to treat anyone free as long as required merck came to the task force for child survival link and made the same offer they had made to who and usaid if they gave the drug free would we figure out a way to distribute it link the mectizan expert committee was formed in to provide a mechanism to make mectizan available for community use to any applicant who could show they would get the drug to the right people in the right amounts that the drug would not be diverted to the marketplace and that all applications would be approved by the ministry of health of their country so that we could have total transparency with the government i chaired that committee for years and the task force hired a few people to run the program i believe in a cause and effect world rather than a world of magic and yet that doesn t keep me from being filled with awe at the inspirational and even miraculous ingredients of this program the birth of the drug involved a soil sample taken from a golf course in japan the scientific facilities and managerial abilities of merck in the united states the obsession and zeal of a researcher named mohammad aziz a product of the indian subcontinent field trials involving people and sites in africa and finally regulatory approval by france this is a global story we saw a magical coalition for mectizan it started quite small including a few people on the mectizan expert committee the group interested at merck and the onchocerciasis control program in west africa but it grew as church sponsored medical mission groups found they could get mectizan but only if they applied through the ministry of health to the committee they worked with governments and a widening coalition developed and soon even the world bank was involved in developing a fund for mectizan distribution so the gift in turn was amplified by a coalition of global organizations ministries of health foundations mission groups community organizations and volunteers all held together by a shared goal rather than a true organizational structure then there is the miracle of mectizan delivery we originally hoped to reach million people in six years we did it in four when president carter got involved the distribution increased rapidly he would talk to heads of state in africa and they would find an interest in the disease if they were interested one could depend on their ministers of health to become interested soon the program was reaching million then million a year each person was at the end of a delivery system that included millions of separate stories with millions of people playing supporting roles and yet despite the odds it actually works we can never become too jaded to simply be amazed at what a coalition can do blindness has decreased transmission rates are being reduced and we can even dream of a time when onchocerciasis is but a memory a footnote in medical texts a curiosity in the oral history of a village there is a metal sculpture commissioned by john moores one of the outstanding warriors in the battle against onchocerciasis the sculpture shows the familiar figure of a small boy investing in the future of his african village by guiding a blind man with a stick the original of this sculpture was dedicated in the merck headquarters s lobby it doesn t highlight the most clever product of merck the most profitable product or the most scientifically advanced example of the company instead it is a monument to human and corporate decency there are also copies of this statue at the carter center the world bank and who headquarters serving as a symbol of hope in the midst of world problems a statement that individuals can make a difference and a reminder that we can mobilize the riches of the world to improve the health of the poorest of the poor
