last week i was in new york for a link at columbia university the event moderated by charlie rose combined two of my favorite things meeting with college students and talking with my close friend warren over the years i ve had the chance to speak with thousands of students at campuses across the country their youthful energy passion and curiosity are infectious and help fuel my optimism about our world likewise warren s wit and wisdom are a national treasure just as he has done for the last link he kept everyone in the room and one million more on facebook learning and laughing warren and i fielded a wide range of thoughtful questions touching on global health fear of failure education innovation business our friendship and books if there was one underlying theme it was our shared belief that despite what we may read in the headlines from day to day the world is getting better and our best days are still to come many thanks to warren charlie columbia university its students facebook and thousands of people who watched the conversation online i encourage you to watch the entire conversation online but here are a few of my favorite questions and excerpts of our answers link link link that s an interesting question i guess what really surprised me initially is that we just found so many things to connect on bill did try to sell me a computer that s probably the only sale he didn t make although the computer changed my life for the better in a big way subsequently but he just had the same curiosity link link i was so amazed that warren comes to investing with this broad model of the world so one of the first questions he asked me was hey microsoft is a small company ibm is this huge company why can you do better why can t they beat you at the software game that you re playing and i always every day i was thinking about okay what advantage do we have what do we do but nobody ever asked me that question and we talked about the economics of software which is a very different and special thing and he could relate it to things that he d seen and i didn t understand banking why some get ahead and some don t and so he was able to put that in very clear terms and so i found somebody whose model was rich enough that it helped me understand things that i really wanted to know and we could laugh about things that were a surprise to us i d say his humility and his sense of humor really stood out in this incredible way i mean he enjoys what he does and he shares that with other people and even when i ask questions that are pretty naive that he s probably been asked times he s very nice about it link link link link america will move ahead when you look at what s happened in this country over years it s an absolute miracle i say the luckiest person in the history of the world is a baby being born today in this country i bought my first stock when i was in april of the dow was if you haven t looked it s something good must have happened between then and it s going to keep happening folks link link well the optimism is partly that i think american innovation is strong support for research is by and large bipartisan and so whether it s health breakthroughs or even energy breakthroughs i think every year that goes by we re going to have more of those things now this administration is new enough we don t know how their budget priorities will come out there are things like foreign aid which is a small part of the budget about billion a year but that means the u s is the biggest that every time there s new leadership we have to go in and articulate the benefits it s well spent it s not the image that people have in the past and so right now i think there s a lot of intensity to make sure we get that message out and get both in terms of the executive branch and the congress to maintain amazing things like the president s malaria initiative or pepfar which is an hiv thing these things started under president bush and so our foundation has had a great working relationship with democratic and republican administrations link link link well i think i was very lucky that when i was in high school the computer was brought in there and i developed a fascination for it and became kind of fanatical about it so that i didn t view it as risky i viewed it as this kind of hobby but i think it s great to be risk taking particularly when you re young trying out different things fields that aren t very popular that you might enjoy link don t fear failure i got turned down by harvard it was the best thing that ever happened there are some good things that happened that didn t seem good at the time don t worry about it and don t let it eat at you by looking back just keep going because you re going to have some things and forget them go forward link link link i d do the same thing for one thing i d be a failure at anything else probably i had fun when i was in my s my s now i m and i m having fun so i advise students as much as possible look for the job that you would take if you didn t need a job i mean don t sleepwalk through life and don t say it s all going to be great i ll do this and i ll do that and i m just marking time to be older as i ve told people that s like saving up sex for your old age it just is nuts it is not a good idea link link well i love the hard sciences and there are some phenomenal things that people will get a chance to be part of i d still probably pick computer science because the work in artificial intelligence today is at a really profound level link link link on immigration this country is built on it if you think about we are sitting here in part because of two jewish immigrants who in in august signed the most important letter perhaps in the history of the united states leo szilard and albert einstein two immigrants came here directly from germany szilard came from hungary before that and they told president roosevelt that the germans were likely to develop an atom bomb which was likely to work and we d better get to work on something fast and the manhattan project came out of that and if it hadn t been for those two immigrants who knows whether we d be sitting in this room this country has been blessed by immigrants and you can take them from any country you want and they ve come here and they ve found something that unleashed the potential that the place where they left did not and we re the product of it link link link well there s no doubt that in order to provide decent healthcare the percentage of gdp devoted to it is going to go up over time it s already very high and yes there s some efficiencies to be gained in that percent or so number but as society ages as we come up with new things like joint replacement organ transplant which are going to create lots of human benefits we re going to have to have more resources overall including more government resources for healthcare so it s a tough problem because you have both access problems today and you have cost problems today and whenever i look at a problem i have this one simple lens which is innovation should help here but in this case innovation while it will provide breakthrough drugs that will save costs like if you can cure alzheimer s which we certainly haven t done yet that will save on huge long term care costs so we have these chronic diseases that we ve made less progress on than some of the others and the market mechanism to get pharma to go after those things and the basic research funds i am quite optimistic that we ll have some advances but they ll also give us some very expensive things that will mean we re spending more money against it and i do hope that at some point that we really are calling on the best minds to look at the incentives for the breakthroughs the most efficient system we have here i think there s a lot of unhappiness in the country now that stems from the fact that the healthcare system isn t delivering and yet people are saying less government more government i don t think they ve been given the depth of education about why it s so tough that over time will help them vote for the right solution link link link my own personal thought is that every life is of equal value and in many ways if you have a limited number of dollars you actually can do more for more people outside the united states and we do have greater resources here for our million people than exists around the world for plus billion people so you can improve the lot of more people by intelligently spending a billion dollars or any other number in other areas of the world actually than here coming from omaha and having the money i have people can say well why not spend it all in omaha you grew up here and omaha has done all kinds of things for you and i absolutely acknowledge that but in the end if i ve got x dollars to spend i can make life better for more people if i can have it intelligently allocated in other parts of the world actually than the united states and that draws a fair amount of criticism but i live with it because it s what i believe link link in terms of helping people in other countries the foreign aid budget of the u s is percent of the budget and there will be in the years ahead a discussion about is that worth doing and in terms of stability and countries eventually being self sufficient to be part of the world economy there are some huge benefits to that so if we were talking about should we spend or percent overseas okay that would be a very interesting discussion but what we re trying to preserve is something that s gotten smarter and smarter all the time has proven benefits all of which are things that our foundation co invests and invests in the same things like polio so i m hopeful that in a big world that can remain a priority link link link well it s a very important question you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with so it s important to associate with people that are better than yourself and actually the most important decision many of you will make not all of you will be the spouse you choose and you really you want to associate with people who are the kind of person you d like to be you ll move in that direction and the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse i can t overemphasize how important that is and you re right the friends you have they will form you as you go through life and make some good friends keep them for the rest of your life but have them be people that you admire as well as like link link some friends do bring out the best in you and so it s good to invest in those friendships and some friends challenge you about things you re doing and that level of intimacy is great it s really through melinda and seeing other people i realized okay it s really worth the investment to have those people as you re always there to help them and vice versa
