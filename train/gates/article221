link the united nations released some link last week that are worth taking a closer look at the news coverage about the reports hit the high points the un projects that the world s population will reach billion by and india could overtake china as the most populous nation around but a lot of the stories i ve seen have missed two key points that are worth calling out first link you may know that the average life span went up in the link century but did you know it increased faster in the past years than at any other time in history life spans rose by nearly percent from years in the s to years in and the u n projects that the average will keep going up for the rest of this century of course the average obscures a lot of variation among countries in most rich countries today the average life span is over in japan it s over while in the poorest it is only but even in those poor countries the un projects that life spans will reach years by the middle of this century so if anyone tries to tell you how much better things were in the old days you can ask them if they preferred it when million kids a year died before age versus about million today and the average human being died before age that leads to the second point and it s a really important one link link link it s counterintuitive but it becomes crystal clear when you look at the data just about all the countries where health is still bad also have high birth rates and as more children in a country survive past age the number of children born per woman goes down it s happened in china india indonesia iran brazil and south africa among other countries why does this happen because when parents know their children will live long enough to support them in their old age they decide to have fewer kids the economist link has written a lot about this point the swedish researcher hans rosling nailed it a few years ago in a link of course it s one thing for people to want smaller families and another for them to be able to act on this wish that s why it s so important to make sure women have access to voluntary link which our foundation does a lot of work on and is a big focus for melinda these two facts increasing life spans and the strong link between family size and child health drive a lot of the work melinda and i do they tell us that the world is getting better that the challenge is to make sure it gets better faster and for everyone and that one of the best ways to do that is by working to save children s lives and supporting family planning when health improves life improves by every measure
