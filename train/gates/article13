shortly after melinda and i got married i told her i was bidding on a notebook that could wind up costing a lot of money don t you already have a great portable computer she asked i explained that by notebook i meant the old fashioned kind and by old fashioned i meant link old fashioned as in more than years old the notebook in question was one of the surviving journals of leonardo da vinci after i won the bid i broke a longstanding tradition i was supposed to change the name from codex hammer the previous owner was the industrialist armand hammer to codex gates but i thought that sounded silly and i changed the name back to codex leicester the name it held from until the codex leicester is not nearly as famous as artworks such as the link and link and dan brown fans will be disappointed to know that it doesn t contain codes protecting age old secrets but it s a scientific treasure in fact there are insights such as one about how blood flows through the heart that were so far ahead of their time that researchers finally verified them only a few decades ago given my fascination with leonardo i was eager to read link walter isaacson s new biography i ve read a lot about leonardo over the years but i had never found one book that satisfactorily covered all the different facets of his life and work walter a talented journalist and author i ve gotten to know over the years did a great job pulling it all together if you liked walter s major biographies of steve jobs and albert einstein you ll probably appreciate this one more than any other leonardo book i ve read this one helps you see him as a complete human being and understand just how special he was he came close to understanding almost all of what was known on the planet at the time that s partly because scientific knowledge was relatively limited back then partly because he had a high iq but mostly because he was insatiably curious about pretty much every area of natural science and the human experience he studied in meticulous detail everything from the flow of water and the rise of smoke to the muscles you use when you smile amazingly he did it with almost no formal schooling his father was a notary a profession that gave him some prominence and prosperity so leonardo never had to work in the fields but because leonardo was born out of wedlock his mother was a poor orphaned peasant girl he was not sent off to school that turned out to be a blessing leonardo got free time to wander look at nature and start creating notebooks full of observations and ideas he became in his own words a disciple of experience isaacson also does a great job of explaining why leonardo s work is so revered unless you re an art historian you might even wonder if paintings like the link are famous just for being famous but walter shows how leonardo s genius is in the details he became fascinated about how a smile begins to form and instructed himself to analyze every possible movement of each part of the face and determine the origin of every nerve that controls each facial muscle he writes tracing which of those nerves are cranial and which are spinal may not have been necessary for painting a smile but leonardo needed to know despite his remarkable artistic talent leonardo barely thought of himself as a painter when he was about years old he applied for a job with the ruler of milan after listing interests from military engineering to science to designing sets for plays he included almost as an afterthought i can also paint there was one downside to having such broad interests he often switched his focus to new domains right in the middle of a project leaving works unfinished here s a classic example after leonardo won a coveted commission to create a large statue of a nobleman perched on a horse leonardo procrastinated by going down multiple rabbit roles for example he dissected horses to understand their anatomy created new systems for feeding horses and designed cleaner stables he never completed the statue and he never published the treatise on horses he started when you look across all of leonardo s many abilities and his few failings the attribute that stands out above all else was his sense of wonder and curiosity when he wanted to understand something whether it was the flow of blood through the heart or the shape of a woodpecker s tongue he would observe it closely scribble down his thoughts and then try to figure it all out it s a bit of a lost art these days even though in the age of free wikipedia entries and youtube videos it s easier than ever to satisfy your curiosity it s ironic that we can be reminded about the wonders of modern life by a man who lived years ago link
