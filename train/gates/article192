i am in vancouver this week attending the ted conference i just gave a brief talk on a subject that i ve been learning a lot about lately epidemics the ebola outbreak in west africa is a tragedy as i write this more than people have died i ve been getting regular updates on the case counts through the same system we use to track new cases of polio also last month i was lucky enough to have an in depth discussion with tom frieden and his team at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta what i ve learned is very sobering as awful as this epidemic has been the next one could be much worse the world is simply not prepared to deal with a disease an especially virulent flu for example that infects large numbers of people very quickly of all the things that could kill million people or more by far the most likely is an epidemic but i believe we can prevent such a catastrophe by building a global warning and response system for epidemics it would apply the kind of planning that goes into national defense systems for recruiting training and equipping health workers investments in new tools etc to the effort to prevent and contain outbreaks this is what my ted talk was about you can watch it here the more i learn about what it takes to respond to an epidemic the more impressed i am by the health workers who have been risking their lives to care for the sick just putting on a protective suit is huge undertaking once it s on it s hard to hear what anyone else is saying and you start to sweat after just a few minutes here s a link about one attempt to solve this problem that i was involved with at ted we also put together an exhibit where attendees could try on a suit for themselves finally if you re interested in learning more you might want to check out link i wrote for the link and if you are willing to read a little more okay a lot more here is a link i wrote for the link melinda and i remain committed to improving the health of the poorest billion the good news is many of the steps required to save lives in poor countries such as strengthening health systems also improve the world s ability to deal with epidemics so i m optimistic that we can solve this problem making the right investments now could save millions of lives link
