last month in a government building in maryland i put on virtual reality headset and got a glimpse of the future of medicine i was touring the link located on the campus of the link nih the federal agency that runs public medical research in the united states our foundation has been working with the nih for years it s one of the most important research relationship we have and we get together occasionally to check in on our progress after a morning of meetings i got to visit the vaccine center with the institute s director francis collins and his colleague tony fauci our tour included a very cool demonstration of how researchers are using vr to examine viruses for weak spots that they could target in making a vaccine or drug this state of the art approach could lead to a universal flu vaccine as opposed to today s seasonal variety and hopefully one day to an hiv vaccine i m investing in a link that s doing similar work take a look that virtual reality model is just one example of the nih s mind blowing work in the united states the nih has played a key role in everything from lowering the death rates from heart disease and stroke to a dramatic decline in tooth decay today alongside the centers for disease control and prevention it s helping us prepare for link link which could kill tens of millions of people if we re not ready for it here are some of the other diseases the nih is working on link one link found that about percent of nih grants generate a patent directly but percent generate articles that are subsequently cited by patents then those innovations lead to new jobs new industries and economic growth the nih funds scientists in every state and supports link nationwide it s a fantastic investment that is advancing the frontiers of science and i would say that even if they didn t let me try out their vr gear
