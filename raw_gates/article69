as regular tgn readers know i m a fan of vaclav smil a czech canadian professor emeritus at the university of manitoba i ve read nearly all of his books i wait for new smil books the way some people wait for the next link movie some years i don t have to wait long in alone smil published four i read smil because he s uniquely good at going both deep and broad many writers who come out of academia specialize in delving deep into a topic they ve studied for years but they typically don t bring together insights from across many different disciplines many impressive writers who come from journalism are the opposite they re great at painting the big picture but they re not as well equipped to depict the fine details smil can do both with equal facility in his latest book link he goes deep and broad to explain how innovations in humans ability to turn energy into heat light and motion have been a driving force behind our cultural and economic progress over the past years yes our history has a lot to do with kings and queens and games of thrones smil shows that it has even more to do with energy innovation here s smil s thesis in a nutshell once groups of humans graduated from hunting and gathering and learned how to cultivate crops in ways that would produce more food than they needed for their own survival they had the time and energy to use their brains in new ways they applied that brainpower to getting even more efficient at converting energy into food using animal power tools crop rotation fertilizers irrigation and new seed varieties the gains in crop production led directly to higher population densities this in turn led to more complex societies and greater specialization of work and an incredible array of advances in every area of human endeavor the past years have seen the most miraculous advances in the human condition and just about all of those advances can be traced directly to the exploitation of new forms of energy smil takes you through these advances in painstaking detail for example he shows that the biggest transition in the human condition started in the mid link century after ironmasters in europe began firing their furnaces with metallurgical coke made from low ash low sulfur coal coke fueled furnaces could be much larger than charcoal wood furnaces and drove an increase in global production from tons in to million tons in a series of additional metallurgical innovations in the late s led to the modern steel industry which has provided the most important material for industrial development ever since with the help of original calculations and some good explanatory illustrations smil describes the other energy related innovations that drove rapid economic growth and quality of life improvements as well as profound environmental degradation in the link and link centuries while many of the innovations will be familiar to you you will undoubtedly learn new things about the steam engine internal combustion engines running on gasoline the generation of electricity the transformer it made inexpensive centralized electricity generation possible and would probably win a contest for a device that is as common and indispensible for the modern world as it is absent from the public consciousness and renewables as usual with smil he doesn t overstate or oversimplify his case he s well aware that energy is not the only way to view the advance of humanity things like morality play crucial roles too energy is not the only determinant of life in general and human actions in particular it is among the most important factors shaping a society but it does not determine the particulars of its successes or failures i ll admit that link is not easy reading in fact when i read my first smil books years ago i felt a little beat up and asked myself am i ever going to be able to understand all of this but link follows an easy chronological progression and is well edited the best way to give you a sense of the book is to share some of the remarkable facts smil digs up as you ll see they range over many different academic fields they are not the kind of things you could simply pull off wikipedia they often involve original calculations that only smil would do throughout every section of the book smil makes a clear case that energy consumption and economic growth are inextricably linked in his words to become rich requires a substantial increase in energy use i fully agree with him and in the past century or so the biggest increase in energy use has come from fossil fuels which are expensive and drive climate change that s why i m spending a lot of my time and resources trying to accelerate research and development to make clean energy less expensive than fossil fuels and just as reliable the main disagreement i have with smil is about how quickly we can make the transition to clean energy he is absolutely right that moore s law and the speedy advances in software have misled people into thinking all innovation and adoption happens that quickly yet i am more optimistic than he is about the prospects of speeding up the process when it comes to clean energy perhaps it s the insights i have gained from my work with link a fund that s investing more than billion in clean energy innovation what i ve learned from experts connected with link link or the research i see going on in the labs of the world s top energy innovators when i learn about their efforts i can t help but feel optimistic about what s on the horizon from link link to game changing improvements in energy generation storage and transmission link i d read just about any topic he found interesting and wanted to dissect but growth sounds like a perfect topic for him i m looking forward to it already
