warning you may find what i m about to write disturbing imagine a fly infected with parasites bites you first you get a fever then headaches joint pains and itching eventually when the parasites cross the blood brain barrier you lose your mind you can t control your muscles and then you lose your life now imagine you drink a glass of water the water contains tiny fleas containing even tinier larvae the larvae mate and grow in your body one year later a painful blister forms on your foot the head of a worm pokes out it s feet long and takes weeks to remove finally imagine a mosquito bites you it s infected with tiny larvae they set up camp in one of your lymph nodes where they mate and nest causing your leg to eventually swell to times its size sound horrific well i haven t told you the most disturbing part i m not making up these diseases human african trypanosomiasis dracunculiasis and lymphatic filariasis they are just three of more than a dozen tropical diseases that afflict some of the poorest people in the world as i write this more than a billion people suffer from at least one of them these diseases go by names that are largely unknown and often difficult to pronounce still it should be easy to understand why we should all care about them spread by worms and insects they disfigure and disable people living in the remotest areas of the world keeping children out of school and parents from being able to work in the worst cases they kill and all of them can be prevented if the world continues to work together to end them i am in geneva switzerland this week for a meeting to raise awareness and continue support for the fight against these overlooked diseases collectively they ve been dubbed neglected tropical diseases but lately they ve been getting some of the attention they deserve five years ago link a group of pharmaceutical companies governments health organizations charities and other partners came together to treat and prevent these diseases they set a goal to control or eliminate at least of them by today there s a lot of progress to celebrate fewer people are suffering from them and many countries are on their way to eliminating them altogether here are some examples of the progress that s been made dracunculiasis also known as guinea worm the parasitic disease i described above in which a large worm grows inside its victims is nearing its end in the disease afflicted an estimated million people in countries in africa and asia last year thanks to the work of uniting to combat ntds the carter center and other partners the number of guinea worm cases has been reduced by more than percent to cases lymphatic filariasis also known as elephantiasis is thelink painful disfiguring disease spread by mosquitoes five years ago billion people needed preventive drug treatment to protect them from the disease since then it has been eliminated in six countries and reduced in others human african trypanosomiasis hat commonly known as sleeping sickness is also in retreat cases have declined by more than percent from cases in to in what s driving this progress it s been the result of drug donations by pharmaceutical companies and generous commitments by donors and governments more than one billion people were reached with ntd treatments in alone across nearly countries new innovations for testing and treatment have also made a big difference for example the diagnostic test for sleeping sickness used to require electricity bulky equipment and refrigeration making it difficult to deliver to remotest areas of the world now a simple finger prick blood test allows health workers to test for the diseases and new smartphone based mapping tools could make it easier to map these diseases so health workers can target their treatment efforts in real time down to the household level still there s a lot of work to be done we need continued support from donor governments to finish the job we need more research on improved drugs and tests to help make it easier to treat people quickly and we must support the frontline health workers who have the tough job of delivering the drugs in the hardest to reach regions of the world if the world keeps up the fight against these diseases we can improve the lives of millions of the poorest families they won t be neglected anymore link link link link link
