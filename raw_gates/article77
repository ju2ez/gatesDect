last week jimmy carter made a surprise appearance at our foundation s annual employee meeting his visit was a huge honor for all of us i think he was an even bigger hit with our colleagues than bono who stopped by a few years ago they particularly loved hearing him talk about rosalynn his wife of over years according to the former president the secret to their incredible love story is simple give each other space and never go to bed angry our team soaked up all the insights he had to offer on love global health and many other topics link for years our foundation has worked closely with the link in the fight against guinea worm disease onchocerciasis lymphatic filariasis and many other diseases melinda and i recently had a chance to spend an evening with jimmy and rosalynn at their home in plains georgia at age and after a scary battle with malignant melanoma president carter is as sharp as ever mrs carter who is also super smart is still her husband s closest friend and advisor in preparation for our trip to plains i read president carter s newest book link the book would have been a worthwhile read under any circumstances at less than pages it s a quick condensed tour of carter s fascinating life his storytelling is simple and elegant just like the wood furniture carter has made by hand all his life although most of the stories come from previous decades link feels timely in an era when the public s confidence in national political figures and institutions is low it is true that president carter made unforced errors during his time in office but when you read this book and have a chance to meet him in person you can t help but conclude that carter is a brave thoughtful disciplined leader who understands the world at a remarkable level and who has improved the lives of billions of people through his advocacy for human rights and global health i loved reading about carter s improbable rise to the world s highest office he spent his early years in rural georgia in a small sears roebuck house without running water electricity or insulation his highest aspiration was to become a plowman on his family s farm his first exposure to the wider world came through his service in the u s navy he earned a student appointment at the u s naval academy during world war ii served as an officer on submarines during the korean war and went on to develop advanced nuclear subs despite being on a fast track in the navy carter decided to return home to georgia to run the family farm after his father s passing a move that made rosalynn furious in retrospect it makes sense that carter would want to follow in his dad s footsteps james earl carter was a strict man who rarely gave his son praise but jimmy revered him this close father son relationship shaped jimmy s whole life to earn his father s approval jimmy became a jack of all trades and a master of most he became skilled at everything from farming to forestry firefighting to furniture making differential calculus to nuclear physics being a master of so many things can also have a downside as president he was often criticized for micromanaging to the point of wanting to link perhaps more than anything else james modeled for his son a commitment to service while running his farm and doing significant manual labor himself james served in the georgia legislature on the local board of education on the local hospital authority and in many other volunteer posts these civic values are what led the younger carter to run for the georgia senate in he s lucky he had rosalynn by his side in that race she had great political instincts and helped him rise all the way to the white house over the subsequent years even though carter had already written more than two dozen books before this one he somehow managed to save some great anecdotes for this book i ll share two of my favorites carter salvaged the camp david accords with a small human gesture israeli prime minister menachem begin was furious with carter and the negotiations were just about to get called off when carter went to begin s cabin and gave him photographs with personal inscriptions for each of begin s eight grandchildren after reading the notes begin had a choked voice and tears were running down his cheeks i was also emotional and he asked me to have a seat after a few minutes we agreed to try once more the rest as they say is history during the iran hostage crisis the cia managed to sneak agents into tehran with false german passports one agent was caught by customs officials something is wrong with your passport the official said this is the first time i ve seen a german document that used a middle initial instead of a full name your name is given as josef h schmidt the agent saved his skin with a brilliant response well when i was born my given middle name was hitler and i have received special permission not to use it link is a good read about a great man it made me think of david brooks s book link and its insights about the values that give life purpose as brooks explains the book of genesis contains two very different versions of adam adam i is the career oriented ambitious side of our nature brooks writes he wants to have high status and win victories adam ii in contrast wants to have a serene inner character a quiet but solid sense of right and wrong not only to do good but to be good jimmy carter brought adam ii to the fore
