when i was younger i read a ton of science fiction i was up to date on all the big authors probably the one i read the most was robert heinlein link was a particular favorite but for the past decade or so i haven t read nearly as much sci fi i just got out of the habit so when a friend recommended neal stephenson s most recent novel link i thought i would give it a try i had read one of stephenson s earlier books link and thought this new one would be a good way to get back into sci fi i m really glad i did because link is a thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable book neal who lives in seattle was nice enough to meet up so we could talk about his work and he patiently helped make this virtual reality film of our conversation it s the first of a series of vr movies i ll be releasing on tgn read the rest of my review below the video the plot of link gets going when the moon blows up without warning and for no apparent reason this isn t a spoiler it s the first sentence of the book the moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason people figure out that in two years chunks of the moon will rain down on earth in a cataclysmic meteor shower wiping out every living thing and leaving the planet uninhabitable for thousands of years the world unites on a plan to get as many spacecraft as possible into orbit where a few select people can ride out this hard rain and keep humanity going the book has so many cool ideas memorable characters and good storylines that i can t cover them all so i will just touch on two things that really struck melink one is stephenson s writing on technology link belongs in the subgenre of hard science fiction which means it emphasizes scientific accuracy everything adheres to physical laws so unlike link no one travels anywhere near the speed of light stephenson tells you not just what happens but how it happens you ll learn all about how orbits work and what it takes to connect two spacecraft in different orbits you ll learn the difference between fuel and propellant there s a long but clever passage about a woman who flies from earth into orbit in a glider while wearing a suit made of intelligent fabric personally i loved all that stuff but if you re the sort of reader who doesn t care how such a thing might work you will find yourself skimming parts of link the other thing that struck me is the way the book pushes you to think big and long term if everyone learned that the world would end two days from now there would be global panic plus a big dose of hedonism but what if it were ending two years from now would people keep going to work would kids go to school if they did what would you teach them in the last third of the book there s a fascinating exploration of the connection between culture and genetics if only a few humans survived and had to start all over what would happen to distinctions of class and race how much are you shaped by your genes your family s history and your own experiences in the wrong hands this material could be dreary but stephenson does a good job of exploring it while moving the story along it helps that he throws in other nice touches to keep you thinking the title is a palindrome though how that s relevant is left up to you the number from the title turns out to matter in more than one way and you might enjoy trying to figure out which characters were inspired by real people there s a famous astrophysicist science explainer who sounds a lot like neil degrasse tyson link reminded me of all the things i love about science fiction it is a great novel to get lost in learn from and think about more than anything else it has me thinking i should get back to reading sci fi again
