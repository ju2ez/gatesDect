when it comes to books it s pretty rare that i get intimidated i read all kinds of books including ones that only the harshest college professors would assign and yet i must admit that for many years i steered clear of anything by david foster wallace i often heard super literate friends talking in glowing terms about his books and essays i even put a copy of his tour de force link on my nightstand at one point but i just never got around to reading it i m happy to report that has now changed it started last year when i watched link a great movie with jason segel and jesse eisenberg that takes place when wallace was on the road somewhat reluctantly promoting link the movie made wallace seem so damn interesting and it really humanized him for me in addition to shedding light on the nature of his literary genius it also foreshadows the depression that led him to commit suicide in recently i also watched an link of wallace s famous commencement speech at kenyon college it is one of the most moving speeches i ve heard in a long time then this past may library of america came out with link a short volume of wallace s essays on tennis the book gave me the perfect opportunity to give wallace a try because i really enjoy tennis i gave up tennis when i got fanatical about microsoft during those intense years my only exercise was running around the office and jumping up and down i m now back on the court at least once a week and have built a pretty solid game for a year old who can t hit a lot of winners from the baseline i would say to anyone who likes tennis as much as i do you have to read link you ll take away insights that go way beyond what you get by reading the typical article in a tennis magazine or listening to a color commentator on tv in this respect the book reminded me of john mcphee s classic link about arthur ashe s u s open victory and link michael lewis s brilliant book about the evolution of the game of football wallace is insightful about the sport partly because he was a very good junior player when he was growing up in the late s using his brilliant math mind to understand and play all the angles on the court his personal experience gave him a lasting appreciation for the physical and mental gifts you need to be truly great as much as i loved the book for its insights on the game i loved it just as much for the writing itself i now understand why people talk about david foster wallace with the same kind of awe that tennis fans use to talk about a roger federer or serena williams wallace s ability to use language is mind blowing he s an artist who approaches a canvas with the exact same oil paints everyone before him has used and then applies them in breathtaking new and creative ways the first thing you have to get used to with wallace is his non linear expository style you just have no idea where wallace s mind or story will go next like a great tennis player who never telegraphs a shot an essay that starts out describing his childhood tennis competitions in illinois will flow into fascinating eddies on calculus geometry meteorology and engineering fortunately almost all of his narrative digressions are both fascinating and surprisingly easy to follow even when wallace uses lots of footnotes even some of the footnotes have footnotes when i was putting off reading wallace i assumed his writing would be pretentious i was wrong yes there are lots of words you ll have to look up online but even with all the sat words wallace just doesn t sound like he s trying to prove he went to a fancy college for every reference to aquinas or wagner there s a reference to beavis or danny devito i came away with the sense that wallace felt compelled to bend language like a metal spoon not to show off his supernatural ability but simply to allow him to capture all the keen observations his mind was constantly making it s almost impossible to illustrate this idea with a single passage of his writing so i encourage you to pick up link or one of his other books and see for yourself but i can give you at least a hint of what i m talking about here s a passage from a review of tracy austin s memoir which was less about the book than about our unrealistic expectations of our sports heroes link techn link with the fancy words english major allusions and winding sentences it s the opposite of the elegantly simple language of hemingway but it s no less articulate perceptive truthful or profound that s why i m now on a big wallace kick i still haven t read link at a whopping pages but i know i ll get to it because this troubled genius who died way too young was the real deal
