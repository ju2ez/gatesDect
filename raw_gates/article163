if you want to read just one book about malaria link is probably the best choice author sonia shah doesn t overwhelm you with data and analytics but she does cover the whole history of the disease which as the title suggests goes back further than you might think the book was published in so it s not totally up to date most notably we ve made progress with rolling out bed nets since then but it s a great overview of malaria its impact and the solutions to it
