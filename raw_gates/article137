the findings of these three mit scientists was a pretty unsettling look at the risk of overshoot overconsumption of the planet s available resources this update offers some encouragement link in three scientists from mit created a computer model that analyzed global resource consumption and production their results shocked the world and created stirring conversation about global overshoot or resource use beyond the carrying capacity of the planet now preeminent environmental scientists donnella meadows jorgen randers and dennis meadows have teamed up again to update and expand their original findings in link meadows randers and meadows are international environmental leaders recognized for their groundbreaking research into early signs of wear on the planet citing climate change as the most tangible example of our current overshoot the scientists now provide us with an updated scenario and a plan to reduce our needs to meet the carrying capacity of the planet over the past three decades population growth and global warming have forged on with a striking semblance to the scenarios laid out by the world computer model in the original link while meadows randers and meadows do not make a practice of predicting future environmental degradation they offer an analysis of present and future trends in resource use and assess a variety of possible outcomes in many ways the message contained in link is a warning overshoot cannot be sustained without collapse but as the authors are careful to point out there is reason to believe that humanity can still reverse some of its damage to earth if it takes appropriate measures to reduce inefficiency and waste written in refreshingly accessible prose link is a long anticipated revival of some of the original voices in the growing chorus of sustainability link is a work of stunning intelligence that will expose for humanity the hazy but critical line between human growth and human development
