foreign aid is often in the hot seat but today the heat is cranked up especially high the united states government one of the world s most influential donors is considering dramatic cuts to health and development programs around the world i understand why some americans watch their tax dollars going overseas and wonder why we re not spending them at home here s my answer these projects keep americans safe and by promoting health security and economic opportunity they stabilize vulnerable parts of the world this is a lesson i ve learned myself when i first got involved in health and development more than years ago the main motivation was to save and improve people s lives around the world that s still true today but over the years i have come to see the tangible ways in which american aid benefits americans too for one thing it helps prevent epidemics the most recent ebola outbreak in west africa killed more than people but the death toll would have been much worse if the disease had spread widely in neighboring nigeria an international travel hub that s home to million people what contained it among other things a group of health workers who were stationed there for an anti polio campaign they were quickly reassigned to the ebola fight and their efforts helped stop the disease and keep it from crossing the atlantic to the united states the biggest public funder of anti polio work has been the u s government and for good reason it is protecting americans and helping us get ready for the next epidemic which could be orders of magnitude deadlier than ebola to stop emerging diseases we need the infrastructure built by consistent funding of well run health programs another example is america s global hiv aids effort known as pepfar which began under president george w bush and works with some of the world s poorest countries pepfar is an undeniable success there are million people with hiv who are alive today because of the medicines that it provides many more never got the virus in the first place because of prevention efforts supported by pepfar this is not simply a humanitarian accomplishment for those countries it means more teachers entrepreneurs police officers and health care workers contributing to strong stable societies according to link political instability and violent activity in african countries with pepfar programs dropped percent between and where there was no pepfar program the decline was just percent better health puts nations on the path to self sufficiency how when health improves people decide to have fewer children because they re confident that the children they do have will survive into adulthood as family size drops it gets easier for countries to feed educate and provide opportunity for their people and that is one of the best ways to stabilize any vulnerable region a more stable world is good for everyone but there are other ways that aid benefits americans in particular it strengthens markets for u s goods of our top trade partners are former aid recipients it is also visible proof of america s global leadership popular support for the u s is high in africa where aid has such a dramatic impact when you help a mother save her child s life she never forgets withdrawing now would not only cost lives it would create a leadership vacuum that others would happily fill syria is a tragic example of what can happen when the key ingredients of stability don t come together beginning in the country experienced the worst drought in its history driving more than a million people from rural areas into the cities stoking political tension and laying the foundation for the horrific civil war that continues today of course there were many causes of that war and not every country that has a severe drought collapses as badly as syria did but the world will not be a safer place if the u s stops helping other countries meet their people s needs none of this is lost on our military leaders more than retired generals and admirals recently wrote a link arguing that u s programs are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm s way secretary of defense james mattis famously said back when he was commander of u s forces in afghanistan pakistan and other hotspots if you don t fully fund the state department which runs many of america s key programs then i need to buy more ammunition protecting americans preventing epidemics strengthening markets saving lives aid delivers phenomenal benefits and for a bargain it represents less than percent of the federal budget not even a penny out of every dollar it is some of the best return on investment anywhere in government this money is well spent it has an enormous impact and it ought to be maintained link
