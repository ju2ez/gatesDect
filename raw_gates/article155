congratulations you ve just accomplished something i never managed to do earn a college degree between your commencement speaker and every aunt and uncle at your graduation party i am sure you are getting a lot of advice at the risk of piling on i thought i would share a few thoughts new college graduates often ask me for career advice i was lucky to be in my early s when the digital revolution was just getting under way and paul allen and i had the chance to help shape it which explains my lack of a college degree i left school because we were afraid the revolution would happen without us if i were starting out today and looking for the same kind of opportunity to make a big impact in the world i would consider three fields one is artificial intelligence we have only begun to tap into all the ways it will make people s lives more productive and creative the second is energy because making it clean affordable and reliable will be essential for fighting poverty and climate change the third is the biosciences which are ripe with opportunities to help people live longer healthier lives but some things in life are true no matter what career you choose i wish i had understood these things better when i left school for one thing intelligence is not quite as important as i thought it was and it takes many different forms in the early days of microsoft i believed that if you could write great code you could also manage people well or run a marketing team or take on any other task i was wrong about that i had to learn to recognize and appreciate people s different talents the sooner you can do this if you don t already the richer your life will be another thing i wish i had understood much earlier is what true inequity looks like i did not see it up close until my late s when melinda and i took our first trip to africa we were shocked by what we saw when we came back we began learning more it blew our minds that millions of children there were dying from diseases that no one in rich countries even worried about we thought it was the most unjust thing in the world we realized we couldn t wait to get involved we had to start giving back right away you know much more than i did when i was your age technology lets you see problems in ways my friends and i never could and it empowers you to help in ways we never could you can start fighting inequity sooner whether it is in your own community or in a country halfway around the world meanwhile i encourage you to surround yourself with people who challenge you teach you and push you to be your best self melinda does that for me and i am a better person for it like our good friend warren buffett i measure my happiness by whether people close to me are happy and love me and by the difference i make in other people s lives if i could give each of you a graduation present it would be a copy of link by steven pinker after several years of studying you may not exactly be itching to read a page book but please put this one on your reading list to get to someday it is the most inspiring book i have ever read pinker makes a persuasive argument that the world is getting better that we are living in the most peaceful time in human history this can be a hard case to make especially now when you tell people the world is improving they often look at you like you re either na ve or crazy but it s true and once you understand it you start to see the world differently if you think things are getting better then you want to know what s working so you can accelerate the progress and spread it to more people and places it doesn t mean you ignore the serious problems we face it just means you believe they can be solved and you re moved to act on that belief this is the core of my worldview it sustains me in tough times and is the reason i still love my philanthropic work after more than years i think it can do the same for you good luck to all of you this is an amazing time to be alive i hope you make the most of it link
