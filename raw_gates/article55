link link link link link link link thank you dr drazen for that kind introduction it s an honor to be invited to deliver the shattuck lecture most of the speeches i give on global health are about the incredible progress and exciting new tools that are helping the world reduce child mortality and tackle infectious diseases thanks to better immunization and other interventions child mortality has been reduced by more than percent since we are on the verge of eradicating polio hiv is no longer a certain death sentence and half the world is now malaria free so usually i m the super optimist pointing out that life keeps getting better for most people in the world there is one area though where the world isn t making much progress and that s pandemic preparedness this should concern us all because if history has taught us anything it s that there will be another deadly global pandemic we can t predict when but given the continual emergence of new pathogens the increasing risk of a bioterror attack and how connected our world is through air travel there is a significant probability of a large and lethal modern day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes watching hollywood thrillers you d think the world was pretty good at protecting the public from deadly microorganisms we like to believe that somewhere out there there is a team ready to spring into action equipped with the latest and best technologies government agents like link in link harvard professors like link in link and who epidemiologists like link in link who even risked getting kidnapped as she pursued patient zero in the real world though the health infrastructure we have for normal times breaks down very rapidly during major infectious disease outbreaks this is especially true in poor countries but even in the u s our response to a pandemic or widespread bioterror attack would be insufficient several things in the last decade have made me pay closer attention to the risk of future pandemics one was the outbreak of swine flu in while h n wasn t as lethal as people initially feared it showed our inability to track the spread of disease and develop new tools for public health emergencies the ebola epidemic in west africa four years ago was another wake up call as confirmed cases climbed the death toll mounted and local health systems collapsed again the world was much too slow to respond and as biological weapons of mass destruction become easier to create in the lab there is an increasing risk of a bioterror attack what the world needs and what our safety if not survival demands is a coordinated global approach specifically we need link an link and a link today i d like to speak with you about some of the advances in tools vaccines drugs and diagnostics that make me optimistic we link get a leg up on the next pandemic and i ll talk about some of the gaps we must address in preparedness and response interestingly the first shattuck lecture given back in focused on a pandemic the russian flu that struck massachusetts the previous year the russian flu was not especially deadly but it was the first flu pandemic to spread across continents connected by rail travel and between continents connected by fast ocean liners the virus circled the globe in just four months but the world was soon in for much worse less than years later the boston area was one of the first places in the u s to feel the deadly effects of the flu military personnel getting off and on ships at the commonwealth pier near where we are meeting today helped carry the pathogen across the u s and back to the battlefields of world war i this animation shows how quickly the virus spread across the united states it took five weeks and killed people the death toll was so great that average life expectancy in the u s for that period dropped by years worldwide the flu killed an estimated million people perhaps more we have better tools today than we did a century ago we have a seasonal flu vaccine although it s not always effective you have to get one every year and most people in the world never get the shot we also have antibiotics for secondary infections of bacterial pneumonia despite these advances this animated simulation by the institute for disease modeling shows what would happen if a highly contagious and lethal airborne pathogen like the flu were to occur today nearly million people worldwide would die in just six months that s the sobering news the good news is that scientific advances and growing interest on the federal level in the private sector and among philanthropic funders makes development of a universal flu vaccine more feasible now than or years ago our foundation is involved in a variety of research partnerships including a collaboration between the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai glaxosmithkline and path their work focuses on several vaccine candidates that did well in animal trials and which are now in human trials we are also supporting efforts by others including the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases whose vaccine candidate is expected to advance to human safety trials in about a year to broaden efforts even further today we are launching a million link in partnership with the page family to accelerate the development of a universal flu vaccine the goal is to encourage bold thinking by the world s best scientists across disciplines including those new to the field lucy and larry page are also supporting efforts by the sabin vaccine institute to encourage innovative approaches that eliminate the threat of a deadly flu pandemic however the next threat may not be a flu at all more than likely it will be an unknown pathogen that we see for the first time during an outbreak as was the case with sars mers and other recently discovered infectious diseases the world took an important step last year to begin addressing this risk with the launch of a public private partnership called the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi with funding commitments of more than million cepi s first order of business is advancing the development of vaccines for three of the priority diseases on the who list for public health r d lassa fever nipah virus and middle east respiratory syndrome cepi is also working on rapid response platforms to produce safe effective vaccines for a range of infectious diseases almost as quickly as new threats emerge later this year cepi will announce grants to several companies working with a variety of technologies including nucleic acid vaccines viral vectors and other innovative approaches the goal is to be able to develop test and release new vaccines in a matter of weeks or months rather than years i m a big fan of vaccines but they may not be the answer when we have to respond immediately to rapidly spreading infectious disease pandemics not only do vaccines take time to develop and deploy they also take at least a couple of weeks after the vaccination to generate protective immunity so we need to invest in other approaches like antiviral drugs and antibody therapies that can be stockpiled or rapidly manufactured to stop the spread of pandemic diseases or treat people who have been exposed earlier this year the shionogi pharmaceutical company received approval in japan for a new influenza anti viral xofluza this single dose drug stops flu in its tracks by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to multiply and prep biopharm a development stage biopharmaceutical company has demonstrated in human challenge studies that pre activating the innate immune response through intranasal delivery of a double stranded viral rna mimic can prevent both influenza and rhinovirus since the host s innate immune response is non virus specific such an approach has the potential to offer protection against other types of respiratory viruses as well monoclonal antibody therapies have also made incredible advances in the last couple of decades leading to several products for cancer and autoimmune diseases during the ebola outbreak in west africa several years ago researchers were able to identify and test a promising combination of monoclonal antibodies to treat infected patients and a growing pipeline of broadly neutralizing antibodies are being discovered in some individuals exposed to infectious diseases for example a small percentage of people infected with hiv develop antibodies with high potency and breadth of coverage sufficient to protect against many strains of the virus the same is true for some people infected with the flu different sets or cocktails of these exceptional antibodies may protect against a pandemic strain of a virus even if it has genetically evolved it is conceivable that we could create libraries of these antibodies produce manufacturable seed stocks and have them ready for immediate use in an outbreak or ready to scale up manufacturing if a pandemic ensues if we can learn how to use rna or dna gene delivery effectively we may not need to make the antibodies at all rapid diagnosis is also critical especially at the beginning of an outbreak when quarantine treatment and other public health measures are most effective to that end researchers at the broad institute and at uc berkeley have developed a highly sensitive point of care diagnostic test that harnesses the powerful genetic engineering technology known as crispr but instead of using crispr to edit dna they have programmed an associated protein called cas to hunt for specific pieces of rna when cas locates the relevant genetic sequence it releases a signal molecule that indicates the presence or absence of the target in a paper published yesterday in the journal link the broad researchers highlighted the field use potential of this new diagnostic using paper strips similar to a pregnancy test and with minimal sample processing the diagnostic can check a patient s blood saliva or urine for evidence of a pathogen what s more it can test for multiple pathogens at once it could for example identify if someone is infected with zika or dengue virus which have similar symptoms there are also some interesting advances that leverage the power of computing to help predict where pandemics are likely to emerge and model different approaches to preventing or containing them over the last few years researchers at the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington have developed a sophisticated computer model that combines data from dozens of sources with geospatial mapping to predict the pandemic risk of infectious diseases they recently looked at the pandemic potential of four viral hemorrhagic fevers in africa including ebola their analysis confirmed that gu ck doulink prefecture in guinea where the west african ebola outbreak originated was indeed one of the most likely places where an individual ebola case could lead to a widespread epidemic the research also pinpointed dozens of other african communities that are at high risk of outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers meanwhile researchers at the institute for disease modeling are pushing the boundaries of computational epidemiology to provide a deeper understanding of both the spread of infectious diseases and the effectiveness of different control and eradication strategies in the effort to eliminate malaria for example idm is combining surveillance data with computational modeling to tailor antimalarial efforts to unique local conditions they are also using quantitative analysis and modeling to evaluate various control strategies for hiv tb and to eradicate polio this kind of research could provide valuable information to help predict disease transmission and identify prevention measures and intervention tactics for epidemics and pandemics at the munich security conference last year i asked world leaders to imagine that somewhere in the world there is a weapon that exists or that could emerge that is capable of killing millions of people bringing economies to a standstill and casting nations into chaos if this were a military threat the response of course would be that we should do everything possible to develop countermeasures in the case of biological threats that sense of urgency is lacking the world needs to prepare for pandemics the way the military prepares for war this includes simulations and other preparedness exercises so we can better understand how diseases will spread and how to deal with things like quarantine and communications to minimize panic we need better coordination with military forces to ensure we can draw on their mobilization capacity to transport people equipment and supplies on a mass scale we need a reserve corps of trained personnel and volunteers ready to go at a moment s notice and we need manufacturing and indemnification agreements in place with pharmaceutical companies with expedited review processes for government approval of new treatments last month congress directed the administration to come up with a comprehensive plan to strengthen global health security here and abroad this could be an important first step if the white house and congress use the opportunity to articulate and embrace a leadership role for the u s in global health security no other country has the depth of scientific or technical expertise that we do drawing on the resources of institutions like the nih the cdc and advanced research organizations like darpa and barda our biopharmaceutical industry is the global leader in biomedical innovation and on the world stage the u s is an influential member of international forums like the un the who the g and the g the point is that the u s can and should play a leadership role in creating the kind of pandemic preparedness and response system the world needs as i said at the start i m fundamentally an optimist and that gives me hope that we can get prepared for the next big pandemic the global community eradicated smallpox a disease that killed an estimated million people in the th century alone we are on the verge of eradicating polio a disease that years ago was endemic in countries and that paralyzed or killed people a year and today nearly million people are receiving life saving hiv treatment thanks primarily to the support of the world community america s global hiv initiative pepfar was the catalyst for world action on the aids crisis it s an example of the kind of leadership we need from the u s on a broader effort to make the world safer from other infectious disease threats with strong bipartisan support pepfar has saved millions of lives and shown that national governments can work together to address pandemics somewhere in the history of these collective efforts is a roadmap to create a comprehensive pandemic preparedness and response system we must find it and follow it because lives in numbers too great to comprehend depend on it thank you for the opportunity to address you today
