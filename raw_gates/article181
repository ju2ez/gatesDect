i visited link link earlier this year to learn more about the progress the country is making in the fight against hiv i toured health clinics met with doctors and researchers and listened to the stories of people living with hiv again and again our conversations turned to an often forgotten disease which is hiv s lethal partner tuberculosis tuberculosis or tb is an infection of the lungs that kills about million every year including people with hiv and tb historically tb was dubbed consumption because it caused such severe weight loss that the disease appeared to consume its patients together hiv and tb form a deadly duo hiv weakens the immune system which makes it susceptible to tb infection and much harder for the body to fight the disease last year about one third of people living with hiv were also infected with tb bacteria and about percent of deaths among hiv positive people were due to tb worldwide south africa has the largest number of people infected with tb and hiv since better testing and treatment programs have helped drive down tb deaths by more than percent saving tens of millions of lives but a new link link found that the tb epidemic is larger than previously estimated new surveillance and survey data revealed hundreds of thousands of new cases the bulk of them in india in there were an estimated million new tb cases worldwide up from million cases in the who report also found that of the million people with tb million of them did not receive quality care because of significant gaps in testing treatment and reporting of tb by health providers tb deaths climbed to million up from million in one of the key concerns among health officials fighting tb is the rising threat of drug resistance something i learned about during a link new strains of the disease have emerged that do not respond to the most commonly used drug treatments available treating people with drug resistant tb is complicated and costly it also places incredible hardships on the patients who must undergo months of treatment using drugs which are toxic and have serious side effects last year simbongile a young mother living outside of cape town learned she was infected with drug resistant tb and started the difficult road to recovery her story is heartbreaking but she is among the lucky ones in nearly people fell ill from drug resistant tb treatment worldwide just in received treatment while the impact of drug resistant tb is a serious problem the vast majority of tb cases are drug sensitive meaning they can be cured effectively with medicines so long as they are taken properly drug resistance emerges because of incorrect prescriptions by health providers low quality drugs and patients stopping treatment prematurely that s why the best way to prevent drug resistance is to improve tb testing and treatment programs for drug sensitive cases tb like so many other diseases primarily impacts the world s poorest people if you live in a wealthy country it might be easy to think as many people do that tb is a disease of the past that fact is reflected in the lack of funding for tb programs around the world in global support for tb care and prevention fell billion short of the billion needed stories like simbongile s however are a powerful reminder that tb is still an active threat and the world is in dire need for new innovations to prevent and treat it by investing more in research and development i know it will be possible to create a new generation of tb drugs and develop a new and effective tb vaccine tb is not a disease of the past but if the world works together to fight it i have no doubt it can be
