this fall more than million students will flock to u s universities and colleges to begin their first year of higher education they ll arrive on campus with the goal of obtaining a degree a proven ticket to a life of higher income and better opportunity but here s a sobering statistic that should concern us all based on the latest college completion trends only about half of all those students link will leave college with a diploma the rest most of them low income first generation and minority students will not finish a degree they ll drop out this is tragic not just for the students and their families but for our nation without more graduates our country will face a link link and fewer low income families will get the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty that s why i m constantly on the lookout for colleges and universities that somehow defy these odds places where students are more likely to graduate than not regardless of race or income georgia state university is one of the institutions that has achieved this goal i visited georgia state university gsu earlier this year and was amazed by what i learned an urban university serving low income and minority students gsu struggled with dismal graduation rates just over a decade ago gsu s overall graduation rate was percent among hispanic students it was percent among african americans percent today the university s graduation rate tops percent a point improvement among the highest increases in the nation during this period what s more there is no achievement gap at gsu african american hispanic and low income students all graduate at rates at or above those of the student body overall gsu is one of the only public universities in the country to achieve this goal and over the last four years gsu has conferred more degrees to african americans than any other college or university in the u s how did gsu do it it didn t take the easy route by shutting out at risk students and cherry picking the brightest applicants in fact the university accepted more at risk students low income minority and academically struggling than ever instead gsu worked to understand the challenges of college from a student s perspective what obstacles prevent students from getting a degree and how could gsu help students overcome them gsu s key insight was that there isn t a single big reason that leads to students dropping out it s dozens of smaller things that disrupt their journey to graduation for the gsu administration digging into these challenges was a humbling experience they realized that there were many things that they could be doing better to serve all their students students come to school with their hopes and their dreams and their families are investing heavily we want to make sure that georgia state is not the cause of them not finishing that we have done everything that we can to create the kind of environment where they can be retained where they can progress and where they can ultimately graduate says allison calhoun brown associate vice president for student success at gsu so gsu redesigned the entire student experience from admissions to graduation clearing a path for them to fulfill their goal of obtaining a degree one of the most remarkable changes is how they have reimagined student advising the university realized it was sitting on a mountain of data about its students data that could be used to better serve them poring over student records million grades and other data the university identified different behaviors that correlated with dropping out for example if a political science major gets a c in an introductory political science course their chances of graduating fall to percent using this information advisers are now able to identify the students who need assistance often before the students know it themselves now when that political science major gets a c an academic adviser receives an alert to meet with the student as part of this effort the university hired more advisers to reach out to students on a one to one basis it wasn t simply a technology fix the human element has been critical to its success here are some of the other obstacles students were running into and how gsu removed them link every year high school graduates across the country who have taken the sats applied to college and accepted offers of admission don t show up for classes in the fall this phenomenon is so common that educators have dubbed it the summer melt gsu found that prospective students got confused about completing financial aid forms signing up for classes and navigating other requirements to enroll link a mobile phone based virtual assistant that would send reminders deadline information and answer thousands of questions about entering gsu from when is my tuition due to how do i register for classes and even stranger questions like can i bring my pet salamander to my dorm in a trial phase of this new technology the summer melt rate among its users declined more than percent link half of incoming students with the weakest academic records were dropping out of gsu their first year link a seven week summer session before fall classes for these at risk students to get oriented to life on campus take college level courses and get introduced to the school s tutoring and advising services the retention rate for first year students enrolled in the program shot up to percent link many of the students who stopped for a semester because of unmet financial need often a shortfall of a few hundred dollars would never return to college link micro grants to students to cover modest tuition and fee shortfalls in return the students met with financial counselors to get them on track to finance the rest of their education students who have received the grants have higher retention and graduation rates than the rest of the student body link look through any course list at a major university and it s easy to get overwhelmed by all the choices offered for classes and majors link instead of declaring a major students decide on one general area academic interest or what s called a meta major stem science technology engineering and math business arts and humanities etc link once students have selected their meta major they are assigned a block course schedule this gives students a clear direction and ensures they earn credits that will count toward a degree even as they are still deciding on a specific major they re also assigned to a learning community of students who are in the same meta major creating an instant group of peers who share a common interest and can study together other colleges and universities have a lot to learn from georgia state university it s no surprise that the university has received dozens of visits by administrators from other institutions wanting to understand gsu s innovations and adopt them on their own campuses if the data and examples don t convince visitors that what gsu is doing is special meeting its students will sitting down with a group of undergraduates and recent graduates was the most inspiring part of my visit fortune onwuzuzruike for example who graduated from gsu earlier this year told me how he entered the summer success academy as a first year student it was an experience that gave him the opportunity to get a jumpstart on his college career and encouraged him to take full advantage of everything on campus he is now working in health care information systems but plans to go to graduate school in business and health administration they do a really good job of connecting the dots for you and actually helping you move forward so you can find out what you want to do in this life he said i also met austin birchell who just completed his freshmen year a first generation student whose family has struggled financially austin was worried about being successful in college especially with no family or relative who had ever been to college to help guide him but thanks to the meta major program and other supports he says he easily transitioned from the small pond of high school to the ocean of college this fall he is signed up to be a tour guide to introduce prospective students to his university i ll be selling them the college and telling them why they should come here and i ll truly do it with a passion because i love this college he says
