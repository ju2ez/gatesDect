our annual letter is addressed to our dear friend warren buffett who in donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation to fight disease and reduce inequity a few months ago warren asked us to reflect on what impact his gift has had on the world dear bill and melinda two years ago i hit the year mark as ceo of berkshire and used the occasion to write a special report to the company s owners i reflected on what had gone particularly well or poorly what i d learned and what i hoped would get done in the future as you might guess i ended up being the prime beneficiary of this effort there s nothing like actually writing something out to clarify thinking it s now been ten years since what my children call the big bang the day in when i made pledges to the five foundations including yours having hit that milestone i thought you might enjoy writing a look backward and forward similar to what i did i m not the only one who d like to read it there are many who want to know where you ve come from where you re heading and why i also believe it s important that people better understand why success in philanthropy is measured differently from success in business or government your letter might explain how the two of you measure yourselves and how you would like the final scorecard to read your foundation will always be in the spotlight it s important therefore that it be well understood and there is no better way to this understanding than personal and direct communication from the two whose names are on the door best to you both what follows is our answer to him it s a story about the stunning gains the poorest people in the world have made over the last years this incredible progress has been made possible not only by the generosity of warren and other philanthropists the charitable giving of individuals across the world and the efforts of the poor on their own behalf but also by the huge contributions made by donor nations which account for the vast majority of global health and development funding our letter is being released amid dramatic political transitions in these countries including new leadership in the united states and the united kingdom we hope this story will remind everyone why foreign aid should remain a priority because by lifting up the poorest we express the highest values of our nations one of the greatest of those values is the belief that the best investment any of us can ever make is in the lives of others as we explain to warren in our letter the returns are tremendous ten years ago when we first got word of your gift to the foundation we were speechless link we knew we owed you a fantastic return on your investment of course philanthropy isn t like business we don t have sales and profits to show you there s no share price to report link our goals are shared by many other organizations working to save and improve lives we re all in this together so most of the numbers we look at don t focus just on how we as a foundation are doing but on link and how we see our role warren your gift doubled the foundation s resources it s allowed us to expand our work in us education support smallholder farmers and create financial services for the poor but in this letter we re going to tell you about our work in link because that was the starting point of our philanthropy and it s the majority of what we do we ll tell the story through the numbers that drive our work let s start with the most important one link link link link link link still we re optimistic this expanding capacity gives us a chance to solve mysteries and save lives and that lets us end our letter with a bright look ahead polio will soon be history in our lifetimes malaria will end no one will die from aids few people will get tb children everywhere will be well nourished and the death of a child in the developing world will be just as rare as the death of a child in the rich world we can t put a date on these events and we don t know the sequence but we re confident of one thing the future will surprise the pessimists thank you for putting your trust in us warren we won t let you down p s people ask us all the time how they can help in the fight against child mortality and we are always proud to recommend making a donation to link an organization that is successful at serving families and children worldwide we hope your gift will help inspire others to get involved as well
