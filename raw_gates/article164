link link link link the superpower question was our favorite to fly to be invisible to travel through time all good options trying to keep up with our foundation work and our three children s schedules we gave responses that will be immediately familiar to other parents link link when we sat down to write this year s letter those answers stuck with us sure everyone wants more time and energy but they mean one thing in rich countries and something else entirely when looked at through the eyes of the world s poorest families poverty is not just about a lack of money it s about the absence of the resources the poor need to realize their potential two critical ones are time and energy more than one billion people today live without access to energy no electricity to light and heat their homes power hospitals and factories and improve their lives in thousands of ways likewise a lack of time creates obstacles too it s not simply the feeling of not having enough hours in the day it s the crippling effect of having to perform the backbreaking work that needs to get done when there s no electricity we are dedicating this year s letter to talking about the opportunities we see to overcome these often overlooked challenges we re writing to high school students because you re the ones who will ultimately be solving these problems our interests in time and energy are separate from our foundation s work on health and poverty but it s all related solving these problems will make it easier to save lives and make the world a more equitable place more time more energy as superpowers go they may not be as exciting as link ability to defy gravity but if the world can put more of both into the hands of the poorest we believe it will allow millions of dreams to take flight at some point today you ll probably do one or all of these things flip a switch for light take fresh food from a refrigerator turn a dial to make your home warmer or cooler press a button on your laptop to go online you probably won t think twice about any of these actions but you will actually be doing something extraordinary you will be using a superpower your access to energy does that sound ridiculous just imagine for a minute life without energy you don t have a way to run a laptop mobile phone tv or video games you don t have lights heat air conditioning or even the internet to read this letter about billion people percent of the world s population don t need to imagine that s what life is like for them every day you can see this fact for yourself in this photograph of africa at night taken from space africa has made extraordinary progress in recent decades it is one of the fastest growing regions of the world with modern cities hundreds of millions of mobile phone users growing internet access and a vibrant middle class but as you can see from the areas without lights that prosperity has not reached everyone in fact of the nearly one billion people in sub saharan africa out of every of them live in the dark without electricity the majority of them live in rural areas you would see the same problem in asia in india alone more than million people don t have electricity if you could zoom into one of those dark areas in that photograph you might see a scene like this one this is a student doing her homework by candlelight link it s been well over a century since thomas edison demonstrated how an incandescent light bulb could turn night into day i m lucky enough to own one of his sketches of how he planned to improve his light bulb it s dated and yet there are parts of the world where people are still waiting to enjoy the benefits of his invention if i could have just one wish to help the poorest people it would be to find a cheap clean source of energy to power our world you might be wondering aren t people just trying to stay healthy and find enough to eat isn t that important too yes of course it is and our foundation is working hard to help them but energy makes all those things easier it means you can run hospitals light up schools and use tractors to grow more food think about the history classes you re taking if i had to sum up history in one sentence it would be life gets better not for everyone all the time but for most people most of the time and the reason is energy for thousands of years people burned wood for fuel their lives were by and large short and hard but when we started using coal in the s life started getting better a lot faster pretty soon we had lights refrigerators skyscrapers elevators air conditioning cars planes and all the other things that make up modern life from lifesaving medicines and moon landings to fertilizer and matt damon movies link was my favorite movie last year without access to energy the poor are stuck in the dark denied all of these benefits and opportunities that come with power so if we really want to help the world s poorest families we need to find a way to get them cheap clean energy cheap because everyone must be able to afford it clean because it must not emit any carbon dioxide which is driving climate change link link scientists say that to avoid these dramatic long term changes to the climate the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to percent by and eliminate them entirely by the end of the century when i first heard this i was surprised link i asked many scientists but they all agreed that wouldn t be enough the problem is that colink lingers in the atmosphere for decades even if we halted carbon emissions tomorrow the temperature would still rise because of the carbon that s already been released no we need to get all the way down to zero that s a huge challenge in the world emitted link of carbon dioxide to produce energy this is a mind boggling number it s worth remembering because it will come in handy for example someone may tell you they know how to remove million tons of carbon per year that sounds like a lot but if you do the math million divided by billion you ll see that they re talking about percent of the problem every reduction in emissions helps but we still have to work on the other percent how can we ever reduce a number like billion tons to zero whenever i m confronted with a big problem i turn to my favorite subject math it s one subject that always came naturally to me even in middle school when my grades weren t that great math cuts out the noise and helps me distill a problem down to its basic elements climate change is an issue that has plenty of noise surrounding it there are those who deny it is a problem at all others exaggerate the immediate risks what i needed was an equation that would help me understand how we might get our colink down to zero here s what i came up with that might look complicated it s not on the right side you have the total amount of carbon dioxidelink we put in the atmosphere this is what we need to get to zero it s based on the four factors on the left side of the equation the world s population link multiplied by the services link used by each person the energy link needed to provide each of those services and finally the carbon dioxide link produced by that energy as you learned in math class any number multiplied by zero will equal zero so if we want to get to zero colink then we need to get at least one of the four factors on the left to zero let s go through them one by one and see what we get link link next services this is everything food clothing heat houses cars tv toothbrushes elmo dolls taylor swift albums etc this is the number that i was saying earlier needs to go up in poor countries so people can have lights refrigerators and so on so link can t be zero either let s take a look at link that s the energy needed per service there s some good news here fuel efficient cars led light bulbs and other inventions are making it possible to use energy more efficiently many people and you may be one of them are also changing their lifestyles to conserve energy they re biking and carpooling to save gas turning down the heat a couple degrees adding insulation to their homes all of these efforts help cut down on energy use unfortunately they don t get us to zero in fact most scientists agree that by we ll be using percent more energy than we do today so none of the first three population services and energy are getting close to zero that leaves the final factor link the amount of carbon emitted per each unit of energy the majority of the world s energy other than hydro and nuclear is produced by fossil fuels like coal that emit an overwhelming amount of colink but there s some good news here too new green technologies are allowing the world to produce more carbon free energy from solar and wind power maybe you live near a wind farm or have seen solar panels near your school it s great that these are getting cheaper and more people are using them we should use more of them where it makes sense like in places where it s especially sunny or windy and by installing special new power lines we could make even more use of solar and wind power but to stop climate change and make energy affordable for everyone we re also going to need some new inventions why solar and wind power are reliable energy sources so long as the sun is shining and the wind is blowing but people still need dependable energy on cloudy days at nighttime and when the air is still that means power companies often back up these renewable sources with fossil fuels like coal or natural gas which emit greenhouse gases it would help of course if we had a great system for storing solar and wind power but right now the best storage option is rechargeable batteries and they are expensive lithium ion batteries like the one inside your laptop are still the gold standard if you wanted to use one to store enough electricity to run everything in your house for a week you would need a huge battery and it would triple your electric bill so we need more powerful more economical solutions link when i say miracle i don t mean something that s impossible i ve seen miracles happen before the personal computer the internet the polio vaccine none of them happened by chance they are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate in this case however time is not on our side every day we are releasing more and more colink into our atmosphere and making our climate change problem even worse we need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas even ones that might sound a little crazy if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century new ways to make solar and wind power available to everyone around the clock could be one solution some of the crazier inventions i m excited about are a possible way to use solar energy to produce fuel much like plants use sunlight to make food for themselves and batteries the size of swimming pools with huge storage capacity many of these ideas won t work but that s okay each dead end will teach us something useful and keep us moving forward as thomas edison famously said i have not failed times i ve successfully found ways that will not work but to find thousands of ways that won t work you first need to try thousands of different ideas that s not happening nearly enough link in sparking new advances as they have for other scientific research u s government funding was behind breakthrough cancer treatments and the moon landing if you re reading this online you have the government to thank for that too research paid for by the u s government helped create the internet but energy research and the transition to new energy sources takes a long time it took four decades for oil to go from percent of the world s energy supply to percent today renewable energy sources like wind and solar account for less than percent of the world s energy so we need to get started now i recently helped launch an link by more than two dozen private citizens that will complement government research being done by link it s all aimed at delivering energy miracles you may be wondering what you can do to help first it s important for everyone to get educated about this energy challenge many young people are already actively involved in climate and energy issues and i m sure they could use more help your generation is one of the most globally minded in history adept at looking at our world s problems beyond national borders this will be a valuable asset as we work on global solutions in the decades ahead second if you re someone with some crazy sounding ideas to solve our energy challenge the world needs you study extra hard in your math and sciences you might just have the answer the challenge we face is big perhaps bigger than many people imagine but so is the opportunity if the world can find a source of cheap clean energy it will do more than halt climate change it will transform the lives of millions of the poorest families i m so optimistic about the world s ability to make a miracle happen that i m willing to make a prediction within the next years and especially if young people get involved i expect the world will discover a clean energy breakthrough that will save our planet and power our world i like to think about what an energy miracle like that would mean in a slum i once visited in nigeria it was home to tens of thousands of people but there was no electricity as night fell no lights flickered on the only glow came from open fires lit in metal barrels where people gathered for the evening there was no other light for kids to study by no easy way to run a business or power local clinics and hospitals it was sad to think about all of the potential in this community that was going untapped link imagine that i m sure you ve seen images like this one i think they re hilarious and they remind me of how much has changed since i was a girl in dallas in the s back when we watched link instead of link my brothers and sister and i had a lot of friends whose mothers as we used to say stayed home link working though now i know that staying home link working and working very hard even though you don t get paid for it the moms in our neighborhood seemed to spend most of their time in the kitchen i m interested in design so i know now that their kitchens were triangle kitchens with the fridge sink and stove laid out to make whipping up an omelet as quick and easy as possible kitchen design was a fad throughout the th century in one demonstration a woman baked two identical strawberry shortcakes one in a regular kitchen and the other in a new and improved version the process required footsteps the first time around but only the second the kitchen itself made cake baking percent more efficient what the triangle kitchen didn t do was challenge the idea that women were supposed to spend most of their lives in the kitchen retracing their steps in a seemingly endless triangle but this is not the s or the s if you re an american three out of four moms at your school have a job link there s a percent chance you live with one parent which means he or she has to do all the paid work link all the unpaid work maybe you split your time between two houses and four parents or maybe both your parents are moms or dads the world has changed a lot i know from listening to my kids and their friends and from looking at polling data about how teenagers see the future that most girls don t think they will be stuck with the same rules that kept their grandmothers in the home and most boys agree with them i m sorry to say this but if you think that you re wrong unless things change girls today will spend hundreds of thousands more hours than boys doing unpaid work simply because society assumes it s their responsibility unpaid work is what it says it is it s work not play and you don t get any money for doing it but every society needs it to function you can think of unpaid work as falling into three main categories cooking cleaning and caring for children and the elderly who packs your lunch who fishes the sweaty socks out of your gym bag who hassles the nursing home to make sure your grandparents are getting what they need now this work has to be done by link but it s overwhelmingly women who are expected to do it for free whether they want to or not this holds true in every single country in the world globally women spend an average of hours a day on unpaid work men spend less than half that much time but the fact is that the burden of unpaid work falls heaviest on women in poor countries where the hours are longer and the gap between women and men is wider in india to take one example women spend about hours and men spend less than hour most girls in poor countries don t have a triangle kitchen instead they move in long straight lines back and forth because they have to walk miles to fetch water and chop wood the geometry of their footsteps is different but it s still based on the assumption that keeping the household running is their responsibility the massive number of hours these girls spend on these tasks distorts their entire lives it s almost impossible for those of us lucky enough to live in rich countries to understand how unpaid work dominates the lives of hundreds of millions of women and girls when i visited tanzania a couple of years ago i spent a few days with anna and sanare and their six kids anna s day started at a m with lighting a fire to cook breakfast after we cleaned up we fetched water once anna s bucket was full it weighed pounds the average distance women walk to get clean water in rural africa and asia is two miles each way imagine doing that with almost half your body weight on your head when we got back to the house i was exhausted even though i d carried less than anna but we couldn t rest because it was time to build the fire again for lunch after that we went into the forest to chop wood for the next day s fires being careful not to get stung by scorpions then we went for more water then milked the goats then dinner we were up past at night washing dishes in the moonlight how many thousands of steps did i take that day however many it was anna had to multiply that number by every day of her life why am i counting the footsteps of women around the world like a human fitbit link it s not just about fairness assigning most unpaid work to women harms everyone men women boys and girls the reason economists call it opportunity cost the other things women could be doing if they didn t spend so much time on mundane tasks what amazing goals would you accomplish with an extra hour every day or in the case of girls in many poor countries an extra five or more there are lots of ways to answer this question but it s obvious that many women would spend more time doing paid work starting businesses or otherwise contributing to the economic well being of societies around the world the fact that they can t holds their families and communities back link link mothers might say they d go to the doctor in poor countries moms are usually responsible for their kids health but breastfeeding and traveling to the clinic take time and research shows that health care is one of the first tradeoffs women make when they re too busy some women might simply read a book or take a walk or visit a friend and i totally support that too link i m writing this because i m optimistic though no country has gotten the balance perfect yet many have narrowed the unpaid labor gap by several hours a day america and europe have come a long way the scandinavian countries have gone even further the world is making progress by doing three things economists call link recognize that unpaid work is still work reduce the amount of time and energy it takes and redistribute it more evenly between women and men let s start with reducing because that s the most straightforward rich countries have done a great job of reducing the time it takes to do most household tasks that s what the triangle kitchen was all about americans don t fetch water because faucets fetch it for us instantly we don t spend all day on a load of laundry because the washing machine does it in a half hour cooking goes much faster when you start with a gas stove instead of an ax and a tree in poorer countries though most women still haul water clean clothes by hand and cook over an open flame link some of you will become engineers entrepreneurs scientists and software developers i invite you to take on the challenge of serving the poor with cheap clean energy better roads and running water or maybe you can invent ingenious labor saving technologies can you imagine a machine that washes clothes using no electricity and very little water perhaps you can improve on the mortar and pestle the year old technology i see women using to grind grain into food every time i travel in sub saharan africa or south asia but reducing by itself isn t enough because it s not just that housework takes a long time it s also that every culture expects women to do it if tasks start taking less time societies can and do simply assign women more tasks to fill up the time they re deemed to have available no matter how efficient we make housework we won t actually free up women s time until we recognize that it s just as valuable as men s this isn t a global plot by men to oppress women it s more subtle than that the division of work depends on cultural norms and we call them norms because they seem normal so normal that many of us don t notice the assumptions we re making but your generation can notice them and keep pointing them out until the world pays attention think about your household chores if you re an american girl you probably do hours of chores a week more than boys if you re a boy you re percent more likely to be paid for doing your chores and what percent of girls chores are inside and what percent of boys are outside why is that in tv commercials you see how often are men doing laundry cooking or running after kids the answer link of the time how many of the women are advertising kitchen or cleaning products more than half link what do those better norms look like how are you going to redistribute the work it takes to live it s not an easy question for example nobody supports a split of all types of work at all times part of belonging to a family is cooperating and sometimes one person is going to change a few more diapers because another is focused on a different important task furthermore not all unpaid work is created equal folding laundry isn t rewarding unless you re one of those obsessively neat people i m not but caring for a child or a sick relative is deeply meaningful and many people bill and me included want to take time to concentrate on that part of life sharing the burdens of unpaid work also means sharing the joys in fact studies show that when fathers are able to take time off from paid work when their children are born they spend more time with their kids and doing other kinds of housework for years to come as a result they form a stronger bond with their partners and children that s one reason why i think access to paid family and medical leave is so important for families in the end the goal is to change what we think of as normal and not thinking it s funny or weird when a man puts on an apron picks up his kids from school or leaves a cute note in his son s lunchbox when it comes to recognize reduce and redistribute the story of anna and sanare the couple i stayed with in tanzania is pretty inspiring when they got married anna moved from a lush part of the country to live in sanare s drought ridden area she had a hard time adjusting to the extra work that meant finally sanare came home one day to see anna sitting on the steps ready to leave her bags packed and their first child robert in her arms sanare heartbroken asked how he could persuade her to stay fetch water she said so i can nurse our son and so recognizing the imbalance he did he started walking the miles to the well every day at first the other village men made fun of him and even accused anna of witchcraft but when he said my son will be healthier because i m doing this they started redistributing the work with him after a while when they got sick of working so hard they decided to build water tanks to collect rainwater near the village now that they ve reduced no matter who goes to get water anna or sanare it s a lot closer and they both spend more time with robert and their other kids link i can t wait to see where your steps will lead you not necessarily in triangles not in straight lines unless that s what you want but in any direction you choose we started this year s letter asking the question link dreaming about whether you would want to read minds see through walls or have superhuman strength may sound silly but it actually gets to the heart of what really matters in your life every day in our work at the foundation we are inspired by the people we meet doing extraordinary things to improve the world they have all tapped into a different kind of superpower that all of us possess the power to make a difference in the lives of others we re not saying that everyone needs to dedicate their lives to the poor your lives are busy enough doing homework playing sports making friends pursuing your dreams but we do think that you can live a more powerful life when you dedicate some of your time and energy to something much larger than yourself find an issue you re passionate about and learn more volunteer or if you can donate a little money to a cause whatever you do don t be a bystander link you may have the opportunity to make your biggest impact when you re older but why not start now our own experience working together on health development and energy the last two decades has been one of the most rewarding parts of our lives it has transformed who we are and continues to fuel our link about how much the lives of the poorest people will improve in the years ahead we know it s an experience that will change your life too you ll be like clark kent ducking away to change into his alter ego emerging not with a pair of tights and a cape but with superpowers you never knew you had energy and time are important issues but there are many others what can you do to improve the world what superpower do you wish you had
