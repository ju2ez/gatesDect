melinda and i went to the amazon a few years ago and enjoyed it so when we were deciding where to go on a family vacation this year it was a great choice it s definitely one of the most amazing places i ve been link and there s this unbelievable ecosystem the amazon is miles long and carries percent of the entire world s fresh water making it the biggest river system by far the nile is longer but it s also narrower whereas the amazon is very wide as much as miles across during the rainy season link even though a lot of the rainforest has disappeared in recent years it is still huge making up more than half of the rainforests left on earth it has more biodiversity than anywhere else including more than million different insects thousands of plant species and percent of all the birds in the world link the amazon river is quite unique millions of years ago there was a river that flowed to the west but then the andes started lifting up blocking the river and creating a huge lake in south america that eventually flattened the land as the andes continued to lift the water finally made an outlet to the east and so the amazon now flows from the west up in the andes down to the east link because of the amount of water in the river basin there are thousands of species of insects fish birds and mammals that have adapted to live in the area including trees that can be under water half the year and still survive fish that jump up and plant their eggs on bushes and fish that jump up and eat insects it s really incredible link starting high up in the andes it flows into dozens of tributaries depending on whether a tributary comes from old rock or new rock it has either mud in it which means you have all these grasses growing creating a super productive ecosystem or it s got mostly just sand and leaves that are decaying link there are three big towns on the river belem is down near the mouth of the amazon where it empties into the atlantic about miles upriver there s manaus and in between there s santarem we spent some of the time in santarem and some of the time in manaus link the real action is up in the canopy of the tropical rainforest where the birds and insects and monkeys are doing their thing a neat thing we did with the assistance of a guide was to climb a kapok tree by pulling ourselves up a big rope on our way up we saw ants and different birds nesting the trees are amazing they grow as high as feet and can be as much as feet in diameter link the original treatment for malaria quinine is found in the bark of quina trees nobody understands how it was discovered as a treatment for malaria because the tree grows at a higher elevation than where malaria occurs someone took the bark and boiled it and knew that if you drank the tea it helped you with malaria quinine was the only treatment for malaria until modern medicine developed a synthetic form in the mid th century one of our favorite things was swimming with the pink river dolphins that inhabit the amazon and its tributaries these freshwater dolphins are curious and friendly with a brain that s percent larger than humans they are one of the many species of animals and plants that have adapted to the unique ecosystem of the amazon basin link for hundreds of years brazil s indigenous people have used native plants to do a lot of amazing things if you have a headache you use this tree to make a remedy if you need to make something waterproof you go tap another tree interestingly about a quarter of all conventional drugs today are derived from rainforest plants manioc also known as cassava is a yam like vegetable which is used as an ingredient and condiment in a lot of brazilian cooking link brazil has developed the world s first truly sustainable biofuels economy based on sugarcane sugarcane is called a c plant which means it s more efficient in the temperate zone the big c plant is corn or maize in the tropical zone it s sugarcane brazil substitutes almost half of what its oil imports would otherwise be by making ethanol from sugarcane there are many companies that are looking at using the sugarcane stalk to make other high value chemicals link embrapa brazil s government agricultural research organization has developed sophisticated agricultural techniques to make productive use of tropical soils they figured out that adding aluminum to fertilizer solved the problem of highly acidic soils in just a few years a mile long tropical savannah known as the cerrado was transformed into highly productive cropland for growing soybeans now after the united states brazil is the number two exporter of soybeans in the world the people at embrapa won the world food prize for their work i ve been reading a lot about meteorology trying to understand weather the weather system in brazil is very unusual you re almost equatorial so you have the weather system from the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere converging with unbelievable cloud formations that are as high as anywhere in the world with a lot of rain and energy in them it s a very interesting weather system link
