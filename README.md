A NLP classifier to determine whether an article was written by Bill Gates or someone else


You can find a full documentaion of what I did [in this article](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/text-classification-the-first-step-toward-nlp-mastery-f5f95d525d73).



Now a slight explanation of the files.


The __xml files__ containing the URLs of the articles I want to scrape.

__parseSitemapToFile.py__: parses the XML file to a textfile containing only the URLs seperated by newline.

All programs that are starting with __scrape__ are there to use the websitesURL files, generated by parseSitemapToFile.py, to scrape the contents of the articles find at the URLs and put the result either in __raw_gates__ or __raw_random_articles__ folder.


__build_dataset.py__ : To take the files of the __raw folders__ and split them into __test__ , __train__ and __valid__ folder.

__classifier_ml.py__ : A classifier which uses ML / NLP techniques.
