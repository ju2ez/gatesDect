there s so much packed into that number child mortality is a proxy for overall well being it s also a leading indicator of progress or the lack of it and when you talk to mothers who have experienced the death of a child you understand what that number means in human terms what is more fundamental than keeping children alive so they can thrive and build the future based on global child mortality data the world is on the right track in the years i ve been working in global health the number of child deaths has gone down every year by a lot six million fewer children died in than in that s more than the total number of children in france unfortunately not many people know about this success on average as my friend and mentor the late hans rosling pointed out chimpanzees do better than people on a multiple choice test about how many children the world has saved i don t quite understand why people aren t more aware of and more proud of this accomplishment still the global child mortality curve doesn t tell the whole story it hides an important insight about what it will take to save the next million if we were to break this single global line into separate lines for each country we would see massive differences among them children are times more likely to die if they happen to be born in angola instead of finland warren buffett calls this the ovarian lottery the work of this generation is to make the ovarian lottery fairer and save millions more lives by addressing child mortality in countries like angola nigeria democratic republic of congo and pakistan where children are most at risk bill and i began investing in health and development because we believed it was possible to eliminate gross inequities we ve seen many poor countries prove the point take malawi in one in four children there died now it s one in this is great news because malawi is closing the gap between itself and finland it s also a call to action because now there s a big gap between malawi and angola to answer the call the world must spread best practices from exemplars like malawi fortunately we are learning a lot about how to save children s lives close to half of the almost million children who will die next year will die in the first days of their lives most could be saved by a few simple interventions for example resuscitation if they can t breathe antiseptics that cost pennies to prevent infection and breastfeeding to strengthen their immune systems cambodia and ethiopia have shown what happens when a country prioritizes its newborns the challenge is reaching the most vulnerable people in the world with basic information and services that save babies lives about million of the children who will die next year will die from diseases that we can prevent with vaccines many countries including bangladesh honduras and tanzania immunize more than percent of their children but there are still nearly million children in the world who aren t immunized at all this explains why measles preventable with a vaccine that costs less than cents still kills almost children every year it s a huge challenge to reach children in countries in conflict or in remote regions hours away from any infrastructure whatsoever but it s doable and it s more doable now than ever before consider how difficult it is to deliver a vaccine that needs to be kept at a specific cold temperature to a child who lives in a desert new coolers using insulation developed for spacecraft can keep vaccines cold for a month and help us reach millions of children we re currently missing in our foundation joined many partners in launching what was then called the global alliance for vaccines and immunization now gavi the vaccine alliance since then gavi has helped more than countries vaccinate million children it has helped dozens of countries add new vaccines against leading childhood killers such as diarrhea and pneumonia to their immunization programs it has saved more than million lives we know what it takes to give millions of children the opportunity to thrive the question is do we have the commitment
