i didn t know what to expect the first time i visited vietnam although i m a bit too young to have worried about my draft number the vietnam war cast a long shadow over my youth like many people of my generation my view of the conflict was influenced by violent american centric movies like link link so i was unsure when i found myself on a plane to hanoi in many of the people i was scheduled to meet with lived through the war would they resent me for being american the answer was to my relief a resounding no everyone i talked to was warm and welcoming you would have never known our countries were at war just decades earlier but the visit made me realize how little i had seen or read about the vietnamese perspective on the war in the years since that trip i ve tried to learn more about the vietnamese experience most recently i picked up link by viet thanh nguyen i don t usually reach for historical fiction but when a good friend recommended it i picked up a copy and i m glad i did link s narrator we never learn his name is a communist double agent embedded with the south vietnamese army and their american allies after he s air lifted out of the country during the fall of saigon he ends up in california spying on his fellow refugees and sending reports written in invisible ink to his handler back in vietnam the story we re reading is the narrator s confession which he is forced to write while held in a north vietnamese reeducation camp much to the chagrin of the camp s commandant this confession makes it clear that the narrator is not a true believer in their cause instead he sympathizes with people on both sides of the conflict for a novel that s been met with such commercial success and critical acclaim it won the pulitzer prize for fiction last year and nguyen recently received a macarthur genius grant it is surprisingly bleak nguyen doesn t shy away from how traumatic the vietnam war was for everyone involved nor does he pass judgment about where his narrator s loyalties should lie most war stories are clear about which side you should root for link doesn t let the reader off the hook so easily more than years later many americans still grapple with the big questions surrounding the vietnam war should we have gotten involved did our political and military leaders know what they were doing did they understand what the human cost of the war would be if you re interested in reading more about this debate i recommend h r mcmaster s excellent book link nguyen largely ignores these questions and instead tackles the role of individual morality in a time of war the narrator commits horrible acts on behalf of the north vietnamese government he serves and the refugee community he s spying on he plays both sides to survive in the end his lack of conviction makes him the most immoral character of all despite how dark it is link is still a fast paced entertaining read i liked one particularly memorable section where the protagonist meets a famous hollywood director and becomes a consultant for the vietnam war epic he s working on called link his attempts to bring the vietnamese perspective into the film are thwarted at every turn by the director who eventually grows so sick of the narrator that he may have tried to kill him with a stunt explosion gone wrong the book doesn t make it clear whether he did or not if you re a movielink buff you ll notice that link bears more than a passing resemblance to link in an link last year nguyen shared the story of the first time he saw francis ford coppola s classic film he described watching a scene where american soldiers kill vietnamese people as the symbolic moment of my understanding that this was our place in an american war that the vietnam war was an american war from the american perspective and that eventually i would have to do something about that link offers a much needed vietnamese perspective on the war i m glad that it s experienced such mainstream success and i hope to read more books like it in the future
