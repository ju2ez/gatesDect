i was sad to learn last month that link of cancer he was just years old david was well known among those who study clean energy and he had a big influence on a lot of people including me but if you don t follow the issue closely you may not have heard of him so i want to take a minute to tell you about david and his work i discovered david through his eye opening book link he was a physicist at cambridge university and his goal was to as he put it cut uk emissions of twaddle by helping people think more rigorously and numerically about clean energy his book doesn t favor one zero carbon solution over another he just shows you how to do the math for yourself so you can work out the answers to big questions like how much carbon do cars emit and how much energy can we expect to get from renewable sources link really shaped my thinking a few years ago when i gave a ted talk on energy i bought copies to pass out to everyone in the audience to this day if you want to understand the opportunities for clean energy nothing else comes close i still go back and re read parts of it myself revisiting his work will be a bittersweet experience now i had the pleasure of getting to know david and learning from him he was always generous with his time and he was just as thoughtful and unassuming in person as he was in writing although he was a knight he never went by sir david he also inspired colleagues to take on related topics with the same rigor and sense of fun one group of cambridge researchers followed his lead with the excellent link david link he also gave a very good link if you are at all interested in the topic i strongly encourage you to take a look at the book and the talk you will not find a more generous and engaging guide to energy than david mackay i will miss him a lot but i am grateful that he left behind so much fantastic work it is a fitting legacy link link
